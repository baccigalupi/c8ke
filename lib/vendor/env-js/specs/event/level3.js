1.1 Introduction

DOM Events is designed with two main goals. The first goal is the design of an
event system which allows registration of event listeners and describes event
flow through a tree structure. Additionally, the specification will provide
standard modules of events for user interface control and document mutation
notifications, including defined contextual information for each of these
event modules.

The second goal of the DOM Events is to provide a common subset of the current
event systems used in DOM Level 0 browsers. This is intended to foster
interoperability of existing scripts and content. It is not expected that this
goal will be met with full backwards compatibility. However, the specification
attempts to achieve this when possible.

The following sections of the specification define both the specification for
the DOM Event Model and a number of conformant event modules designed for use
within the model. The DOM Event Model consists of:

    * The DOM event flow, which describe the flow of events in a tree-based
      structure.
    * A set of interfaces to access contextual information on events and to
      register event listeners.

1.1.1 Event flows

This document specifies an event flow for tree-based structures: DOM event
flow. While it is expected that HTML and XML applications will follow this
event flow, applications might reuse the interfaces defined in this document
for non tree-based structures. In that case, it is the responsibility of such
applications to define their event flow and how it relates to the DOM event
flow. An example of such use can be found in [DOM Level 3 Load and Save].

1.1.2 Conformance

An implementation is DOM Level 3 Events conformant if it supports the Core
module defined in [DOM Level 2 Core], the DOM event flow and the interfaces
with their associated semantics defined in Basic interfaces. An implementation
conforms to a DOM Level 3 Events module if it conforms to DOM Level 3 Events
and the event types defined in the module. An implementation conforms to an
event type if it conforms to its associated semantics and DOM interfaces. For
example, an implementation conforms to the DOM Level 3 User Interface Events
module (see User Interface event types) if it conforms to DOM Level 3 Events
(i.e. implements all the basic interfaces), can generate the event types
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"}
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMFocusIn"}
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMFocusOut"} accordingly to their
semantics, supports the UIEvent interface, and conforms to the DOM Level 2
Core module.

Note: An implementation which does not conform to an event module can still
implement the DOM interfaces associated with it. The DOM application can then
create an event object using the DocumentEvent.createEvent() method and
dispatch an event type associated with this interface using the
EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method.

A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the
DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "Events" and "3.0"
(respectively) to determine whether or not DOM Level 3 Events is supported by
the implementation. In order to fully support DOM Level 3 Events, an
implementation must also support the "Core" feature defined in the DOM Level 2
Core specification [DOM Level 2 Core] and use the DOM event flow. For
additional information about conformance, please see the DOM Level 3 Core
specification [DOM Level 3 Core]. DOM Level 3 Events is built on top of DOM
Level 2 Events [DOM Level 2 Events], i.e. a DOM Level 3 Events implementation
where hasFeature("Events", "3.0") returns true must also return true when the
version number is "2.0", "" or, null.

Each event module describes its own feature string in the event module
listing.

1.2 DOM event flow

The DOM event flow is the process through which the event originates from the
DOM Events implementation and is dispatched into a tree. Each event has an
event target, a targeted node in the case of the DOM Event flow, toward which
the event is dispatched by the DOM Events implementation.

1.2.1 Phases

The event is dispatched following a path from the root of the tree to this
target node. It can then be handled locally at the target node level or from
any target's ancestors higher in the tree. The event dispatching (also called
event propagation) occurs in three phases and the following order:

   1. The capture phase: the event is dispatched to the target's ancestors
      from the root of the tree to the direct parent of the target node.
   2. The target phase: the event is dispatched to the target node.
   3. The bubbling phase: the event is dispatched to the target's ancestors
      from the direct parent of the target node to the root of the tree.

event flow

Figure: graphical representation of an event dispatched in a DOM tree using
the DOM event flow [SVG 1.0 version]

Note: An SVG 1.0 version of the representation above is also available.

The target's ancestors are determined before the initial dispatch of the
event. If the target node is removed during the dispatching, or a target's
ancestor is added or removed, the event propagation will always be based on
the target node and the target's ancestors determined before the dispatch.

Some events may not necessarily accomplish the three phases of the DOM event
flow, e.g. the event could only be defined for one or two phases. As an
example, events defined in this specification will always accomplish the
capture and target phases but some will not accomplish the bubbling phase
("bubbling events" versus "non-bubbling events", see also the Event.bubbles
attribute).

1.2.2 Event listeners

Each node encountered during the dispatch of the event may contain event
listeners.

1.2.2.1 Registration of event listeners

Event listeners can be registered on all nodes in the tree for a specific type
of event (Event types) or event category (Event types and event categories),
phase, and group (Event groups).

If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event gets
processed on this node, the event listener will not be triggered during the
current phase but may be triggered during a later phase in the event flow,
i.e. the bubbling phase.

1.2.2.2 Event groups

An event listener is always part of a group. It is either explicitly in a
group if a group has been specified at the registration or implicitly in the
default group if no group has been specified. Within a group, event listeners
are ordered in their order of registration. If two event listeners {A1, A2},
which are part of the same group, are registered one after the other (A1, then
A2) for the same phase, the DOM event flow guarantees their triggering order
(A1, then A2). If the two listeners are not part of the same group, no
specification is made as to the order in which they will be triggered.

In general, a DOM application does not need to define and use a separate group
unless other event listeners, external to the DOM application, may change the
event propagation (e.g. from a concurrent DOM application, from imported
functionalities that rely on the event system, etc.).

Note: While this specification does not specify a full ordering (i.e. groups
are still unordered), it does specify ordering within a group. This implies
that if the event listeners {A1, A2, B1, B2}, with A and B being two different
groups, are registered for the same phase in the order A1, A2, B1, and B2, the
following triggering orders are possible and conform to the DOM event flow:
{A1, A2, B1, B2}, {A1, B1, A2, B2}, {B1, A1, A2, B2}, {A1, B1, B2, A2}, {B1,
A1, B2, A2}, {B1, B2, A1, A2}. DOM Events implementations may impose
priorities on groups but DOM applications must not rely on it. Unlike this
specification, [DOM Level 2 Events] did not specify any triggering order for
event listeners.

});
/******************************************************************************

1.2.2.3 Triggering an event listener

When the event is dispatched through the tree, from node to node, event
listeners registered on the node are triggered if the following three
conditions are all met:

   1. they were registered for the same type of event, or the same category.
   2. they were registered for the same phase;
   3. the event propagation has not been stopped for the group.
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.2.2.4 Removing an event listener

If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being processed
on the node, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Once removed,
the event listener is never invoked again (unless registered again for future
processing).
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.2.2.5 Reentrance

It is expected that actions taken by an event listener may cause additional
events to be dispatched. Additional events should be handled in a synchronous
manner and may cause reentrance into the event model. If an event listener
fires a new event using EventTarget.dispatchEvent(), the event propagation
that causes the event listener to be triggered will resume only after the
event propagation of the new event is completed.

Since implementations may have restrictions such as stack-usage or other
memory requirements, applications should not depend on how many synchronous
events may be triggered.
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.2.2.6 Event propagation and event groups

All event listeners are part of a group (see Registration of event listeners).
An event listener may prevent event listeners that are part of a same group
from being triggered. The effect can be:

    * immediate: no more event listeners from the same group will be triggered
      by the event object (see Event.stopImmediatePropagation());
    * deferred until all event listeners from the same group have been
      triggered on the current node, i.e. the event listeners of the same
      group attached on other nodes will not be triggered (see
      Event.stopPropagation()).

If two event listeners are registered for two different groups, one cannot
prevent the other from being triggered.
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.3 Default actions and cancelable events

Implementations may have a default action associated with an event type. An
example is the [HTML 4.01] form element. When the user submits the form (e.g.
by pressing on a submit button), the event
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "submit"} is dispatched to the element
and the default action for this event type is generally to send a request to a
Web server with the parameters from the form.

The default actions are not part of the DOM Event flow. Before invoking a
default action, the implementation must first dispatch the event as described
in the DOM event flow.

A cancelable event is an event associated with a default action which is
allowed to be canceled during the DOM event flow. At any phase during the
event flow, the triggered event listeners have the option of canceling the
default action or allowing the default action to proceed. In the case of the
hyperlink in the browser, canceling the action would have the result of not
activating the hyperlink. Not all events defined in this specification are
cancelable events.

Different implementations will specify their own default actions, if any,
associated with each event. The DOM Events specification does not attempt to
specify these actions.

This specification does not provide mechanisms for accessing default actions
or adding new ones.

Note: Some implementations also provide default actions before the dispatch of
the event. It is not possible to cancel those default actions and this
specification does not address them. An example of such default actions can be
found in [DOM Level 2 HTML] on the HTMLInputElement.checked attribute.
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.4 Event types

Each event is associated with a type, called event type. The event type is
composed of a local name and a namespace URI as used in [DOM Level 3 Core].
All events defined in this specification use the namespace URI
"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events".
******************************************************************************/
test('TODO:', function(){
    
});
/******************************************************************************

1.4.1 Event types and event categories

An event type could be part of one or more categories. A category is
represented using a local name and a namespace URI as defined in [XML
Namespaces]. The event types defined in this specification are not associated
with one or more event categories and this specification does not provide
methods to associate them. Other specifications may create and associate event
categories with event listeners but in such case would need to inform the
dispatch mechanism of those event categories. An example of the use of
categories is given at Using VoiceXML Events.

1.4.2 Complete list of event types

Depending on the level of DOM support, or the devices used for display (e.g.
screen) or interaction (e.g. mouse, keyboard, touch screen, voice, ...), these
event types can be generated by the implementation. When used with an [XML
1.0] or [HTML 4.01] application, the specifications of those languages may
restrict the semantics and scope (in particular the possible target nodes)
associated with an event type. For example,
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "click"} can be targeted to all [XHTML
1.0] elements except applet, base, basefont, bdo, br, font, frame, frameset,
head, html, iframe, isindex, meta, param, script, style, and title. Refer to
the specification defining the language used in order to find those
restrictions or to find event types that are not defined in this document.

The following list defines all event types (with the exception of two event
types preserved for backward compatibility with [HTML 4.01], see HTML Events)
provided in this specification. All event types defined in this specification
are bound to the namespace URI "http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events" and the
following list only enumerates the local name of the event type.

DOMActivate
    An element is activated, for instance, using a mouse device, a keyboard
    device, or a voice command.
    
     Note: The activation of an element is device dependent but is also
    application dependent, e.g. a link in a document can be activated using a
    mouse click or a mouse double click.

As an example, the event {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "load"} will
trigger event listeners attached on Element nodes for that event and on the
capture and target phases. This event cannot be cancelled. If an event
listener for the load event is attached to a node other than Element nodes, or
if it is attached to the bubbling phase only, this event listener cannot be
triggered.

The event objects associated with the event types described above may contain
context information. Refer to the description of the DOM interfaces for
further information.

1.4.3 Compatibility with DOM Level 2 Events

Namespace URIs were only introduced in DOM Level 3 Events and were not part of
DOM Level 2 Events. DOM Level 2 Events methods are namespace ignorant and the
event type is only represented by an XML name, specified in the Event.type
attribute.

Therefore, while it is safe to use these methods when not dealing with
namespaces, using them and the new ones at the same time should be avoided.
DOM Level 2 Events methods solely identify events by their Event.type. On the
contrary, the namespaces aware DOM Level 3 Events methods, identify attribute
nodes by their Event.namespaceURI and Event.type. Because of this fundamental
difference, mixing both sets of methods can lead to unpredictable results. For
example, using EventTarget.addEventListenerNS(namespaceURI, type, listener,
...), two event listeners (or more) could be registered using the same type
and same useCapture values, but different namespaceURIs. Calling
EventTarget.removeEventListener(type, listener, ...) with that type and
useCapture could then remove any or none of those event listeners. The result
depends on the implementation. The only guarantee in such cases is that all
methods which access an event listener by its namespaceURI and type will
access the same event listener. For instance,
EventTarget.removeEventListenerNS(namespaceURI, type, listener, ...) removes
the event that EventTarget.addEventListenerNS(namespaceURI, type, listener,
...) added.

For compatibility reasons, the dispatching of an event will ignore namespace
URIs if either the event or the event listener has a null namespace URI. If a
DOM Level 2 event (i.e. with a null namespace URI) is dispatched in the DOM
tree, all event listeners that match the type will be triggered as described
in the DOM event flow. If a DOM Level 3 event (i.e. with a namespace URI) is
dispatched in the DOM tree, all event listeners with the same type and the
same or null namespace URI will be triggered as described in the DOM event
flow.

1.5 Event listener registration

Note: This section is informative.

There are mainly two ways to associate an event listener to a node in the
tree:

   1. at the programming level using the EventTarget methods.
   2. at the document level using [XML Events] or an ad-hoc syntax, as the
      ones provided in [XHTML 1.0] or [SVG 1.1].

1.5.1 Using the EventTarget methods

The user can attach an event listener using the methods on the EventTarget
interface:

myCircle.addEventListenerNS("http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events",
                            "DOMActivate",
                            myListener,
                            true,
                            null);

The methods do not provide the ability to register the same event listener
more than once for the same event type and the same phase. It is not possible
to register an event listener:

    * for only one of the target and bubbling phases since those phases are
      coupled during the registration (but the listener itself could ignore
      events during one of these phases if desired).
    * for a specific event category.

To register an event listener, DOM applications must use the methods
EventTarget.addEventListener() and EventTarget.addEventListenerNS().

An EventListener being registered on an EventTarget may choose to have that
EventListener triggered during the capture phase by specifying the useCapture
parameter of the EventTarget.addEventListener() or
EventTarget.addEventListenerNS() methods to be true. If false, the
EventListener will be triggered during the target and bubbling phases.

1.5.2 Using XML Events

In [XML Events], event listeners are attached using elements and attributes:

<listener event="DOMActivate" observer="myCircle" handler="#myListener"
          phase="capture" propagate="stop"/>

Event listeners can only be registered on Element nodes, i.e. other Node types
are not addressable, and cannot be registered for a specific group either,
i.e. they are always attached to the default group. The target phase and the
bubbling phase are coupled during the registration. [XML Events] does not
address namespaces in event types. If the value of the event attribute of the
listener element contains a colon (':'), it should be interpreted as a QName
as defined in [XML Schema Part 2].

1.5.3 Using VoiceXML Events

In [VoiceXML 2.0], event listeners are attached using elements:

<form>
  <field>
    <prompt>Please say something</prompt>
    <catch event="error.noauthorization">
     <prompt>You don't have the authorization!</prompt>
    </catch>
    <catch event="connection.disconnect.hangup">
     <prompt>Connection error</prompt>
    </catch>
    <catch event="connection.disconnect">
     <prompt>Connection error</prompt>
    </catch>
  </field>
  <catch event="error">
    <prompt>Unknown error</prompt>
  </catch>
</form>

Event listeners can only be registered on Element nodes, i.e. other Node types
are not addressable, and cannot be registered for a specific group either,
i.e. they are always attached to the default group. The target phase and the
bubbling phase are coupled during the registration. [VoiceXML 2.0] does not
address namespaces in event types but uses the notion of event categories. The
event type "connection.disconnect.hangup" could be associated to the event
categories {"http://www.example.org/2003/voicexml", "connection"} and
{"http://www.example.org/2003/voicexml", "connection.disconnect"}.

});
/******************************************************************************

1.5.4 Using XML or HTML attributes

In languages such as [HTML 4.01], [XHTML 1.0], or [SVG 1.1], event listeners
are specified as attributes:

<circle id="myCircle" onactivate="myListener(evt)"
        cx="300" cy="225" r="100" fill="red"/>

Since only one attribute with the same name can appear on an element, it is
therefore not possible to register more than one event listener on a single
EventTarget for the event type. Also, event listeners can only be registered
on Element nodes for the target phase and bubbling phase, i.e. other Node
types and the capture phase are not addressable with these languages. Event
listeners cannot be registered for a specific group either, i.e. they are
always attached to the default group.

In order to achieve compatibility with those languages, implementors may view
the setting of attributes which represent event handlers as the creation and
registration of an EventListener on the EventTarget. The value of useCapture
defaults to false. This EventListener behaves in the same manner as any other
EventListeners which may be registered on the EventTarget. If the attribute
representing the event listener is changed, this may be viewed as the removal
of the previously registered EventListener and the registration of a new one.
Furthermore, no specification is made as to the order in which event
attributes will receive the event with regards to the other EventListeners on
the EventTarget.

1.6 Basic interfaces

The interfaces described in this section are fundamental to DOM Level 3 Events
and must always be supported by the implementation.

Interface Event (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The Event interface is used to provide contextual information about an
    event to the listener processing the event. An object which implements the
    Event interface is passed as the parameter to an EventListener. More
    specific context information is passed to event listeners by deriving
    additional interfaces from Event which contain information directly
    relating to the type of event they represent. These derived interfaces are
    also implemented by the object passed to the event listener.
    
    To create an instance of the Event interface, use the
    DocumentEvent.createEvent("Event") method call.

    Definition group PhaseType

        An integer indicating which phase of the event flow is being processed
        as defined in DOM event flow.

        Defined Constants

            AT_TARGET
                The current event is in the target phase, i.e. it is being
                evaluated at the event target.
            BUBBLING_PHASE
                The current event phase is the bubbling phase. 
            CAPTURING_PHASE
                The current event phase is the capture phase. 

    Attributes

        bubbles of type boolean, readonly
            Used to indicate whether or not an event is a bubbling event. If
            the event can bubble the value is true, otherwise the value is
            false.
        cancelable of type boolean, readonly
            Used to indicate whether or not an event can have its default
            action prevented (see also Default actions and cancelable events).
            If the default action can be prevented the value is true,
            otherwise the value is false.
        currentTarget of type EventTarget, readonly
            Used to indicate the EventTarget whose EventListeners are
            currently being processed. This is particularly useful during the
            capture and bubbling phases. This attribute could contain the
            target node or a target ancestor when used with the DOM event
            flow.
        eventPhase of type unsigned short, readonly
            Used to indicate which phase of event flow is currently being
            accomplished.
        namespaceURI of type DOMString, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 3
            The namespace URI associated with this event at creation time, or
            null if it is unspecified.

            For events initialized with a DOM Level 2 Events method, such as
            Event.initEvent(), this is always null.
        target of type EventTarget, readonly
            Used to indicate the event target. This attribute contains the
            target node when used with the DOM event flow.
        timeStamp of type DOMTimeStamp, readonly
            Used to specify the time (in milliseconds relative to the epoch)
            at which the event was created. Due to the fact that some systems
            may not provide this information the value of timeStamp may be not
            available for all events. When not available, a value of 0 will be
            returned. Examples of epoch time are the time of the system start
            or 0:0:0 UTC 1st January 1970.
        type of type DOMString, readonly
            The name should be an NCName as defined in [XML Namespaces] and is
            case-sensitive.

            If the attribute Event.namespaceURI is different from null, this
            attribute represents a local name.

    Methods

        initEvent
            The initEvent method is used to initialize the value of an Event
            created through the DocumentEvent.createEvent method. This method
            may only be called before the Event has been dispatched via the
            EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method. If the method is called
            several times before invoking EventTarget.dispatchEvent, only the
            final invocation takes precedence. This method has no effect if
            called after the event has been dispatched. If called from a
            subclass of the Event interface only the values specified in this
            method are modified, all other attributes are left unchanged.

            This method sets the Event.type attribute to eventTypeArg, and
            Event.namespaceURI to null. To initialize an event with a
            namespace URI, use the Event.initEventNS(namespaceURIArg,
            eventTypeArg, ...) method.

            Parameters

            eventTypeArg of type DOMString

            canBubbleArg of type boolean

Interface EventTarget (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The EventTarget interface is implemented by all the objects which could be
    event targets in an implementation which supports the Event flows. The
    interface allows registration, removal or query of event listeners, and
    dispatch of events to an event target.
    
    When used with DOM event flow, this interface is implemented by all
    target nodes and target ancestors, i.e. all DOM Nodes of the tree support
    this interface when the implementation conforms to DOM Level 3 Events and,
    therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific
    casting methods on an instance of the Node interface.
    
    Invoking addEventListener or addEventListenerNS multiple times on the
    same EventTarget with the same parameters (namespaceURI, type, listener,
    and useCapture) is considered to be a no-op and thus independently of the
    event group. They do not cause the EventListener to be called more than
    once and do not cause a change in the triggering order. In order to
    guarantee that an event listener will be added to the event target for the
    specified event group, one needs to invoke removeEventListener or
    removeEventListenerNS first.

            listener of type EventListener
                The listener parameter takes an object implemented by the user
                which implements the EventListener interface and contains the
                method to be called when the event occurs.
            useCapture of type boolean
                If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to add the

1.6.1 Event creation

In most cases, the events dispatched by the DOM Events implementation are also
created by the implementation. It is however possible to simulate events such
as mouse events by creating the Event objects and dispatch them using the DOM
Events implementation.

DOM Events provides two ways for creating Event objects. An application can
either create Event objects that are known to the implementation, or create
its own objects and have them dispatched by the DOM Events implementation.

Creating Event objects that are known to the DOM Events implementation is done
using DocumentEvent.createEvent(). The application must then initialize the
object by calling the appropriate initialization method before invoking
EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). The Event objects created must be known by the
DOM Events implementation; otherwise an event exception is thrown.

The DOM application might want to create its own Event objects, in order to
change the default Event implementation provided by the DOM Events
implementation or to generate new event types with specific contextual
information. In any case, the application is responsible for creating and
initializing the Event object. The application can then dispatch the event
using the DOM Events implementation by using EventTarget.dispatchEvent().

However, the DOM Events implementation requires to have access to two
attributes in the Event object in order to accomplish the dispatch
appropriately: Event.currentTarget and Event.eventPhase. Those attributes are
defined as readonly in the Event interface since event listeners must not
change them and it is the responsibility of the DOM Events implementation to
update them during the event flow. Therefore, implementing the Event interface
when creating its own events is not enough for an application since the DOM
Events implementation will not be able to update the current phase and the
current node during the dispatch, unless the event object also implements the
CustomEvent interface to give access to the relevant attributes.

Interface DocumentEvent (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The DocumentEvent interface provides a mechanism by which the user can
    create an Event object of a type supported by the implementation. If the
    feature "Events" is supported by the Document object, the DocumentEvent
    interface must be implemented on the same object. If the feature "+Events"
    is supported by the Document object, an object that supports the
    DocumentEvent interface must be returned by invoking the method
    Node.getFeature("+Events", "3.0") on the Document object.

            eventType of type DOMString
                The eventType parameter specifies the name of the DOM Events
                interface to be supported by the created event object, e.g.
                "Event", "MouseEvent", "MutationEvent" and so on. If the Event
                is to be dispatched via the EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method
                the appropriate event init method must be called after
                creation in order to initialize the Event's values.

                As an example, a user wishing to synthesize some kind of
                UIEvent would invoke DocumentEvent.createEvent("UIEvent"). The
                UIEvent.initUIEventNS() method could then be called on the
                newly created UIEvent object to set the specific type of user
                interface event to be dispatched,
                {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"} for
                example, and set its context information, e.g. UIEvent.detail
                in this example.

                The createEvent method is used in creating Events when it is
                either inconvenient or unnecessary for the user to create an
                Event themselves. In cases where the implementation provided
                Event is insufficient, users may supply their own Event
                implementations for use with the EventTarget.dispatchEvent()
                method. However, the DOM implementation needs access to the
                attributes Event.currentTarget and Event.eventPhase to
                appropriately propagate the event in the DOM tree. Therefore
                users' Event implementations might need to support the
                CustomEvent interface for that effect.
                
                Note: For backward compatibility reason, "UIEvents",
                "MouseEvents", "MutationEvents", and "HTMLEvents" feature
                names are valid values for the parameter eventType and
                represent respectively the interfaces "UIEvent", "MouseEvent",

Interface CustomEvent (introduced in DOM Level 3)

    The CustomEvent interface gives access to the attributes
    Event.currentTarget and Event.eventPhase. It is intended to be used by the

    The methods contained in this interface are not intended to be used by a

    Changing the current target or the current phase may result in
    unpredictable results of the event flow. The DOM Events implementation
    should ensure that both methods return the appropriate current target and
    phase before invoking each event listener on the current target to protect
    DOM applications from malicious event listeners.
    
    Note: If this interface is supported by the event object,

1.7 Event module definitions

The DOM Event Model allows a DOM implementation to support multiple modules of
events. The model has been designed to allow addition of new event modules if
required. The DOM will not attempt to define all possible events. For purposes
of interoperability, the DOM defines a module of user interface events
including lower level device dependent events and a module of document
mutation events.

1.7.1 User Interface event types

The User Interface event module contains basic event types associated with
user interfaces.

Interface UIEvent (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The UIEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated
    with User Interface events.
    
    To create an instance of the UIEvent interface, use the
    DocumentEvent.createEvent("UIEvent") method call.

1.7.3 Mouse event types

The Mouse event module originates from the [HTML 4.01] onclick, ondblclick,
onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove, and onmouseout attributes.
This event module is specifically designed for use with pointing input
devices, such as a mouse or a trackball.

Interface MouseEvent (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The MouseEvent interface provides specific contextual information
    associated with Mouse events.
    
    In the case of nested elements mouse events are always targeted at the
    most deeply nested element. Ancestors of the targeted element may use
    bubbling to obtain notification of mouse events which occur within theirs
    descendent elements.
    
    To create an instance of the MouseEvent interface, use the
    DocumentEvent.createEvent("MouseEvent") method call.
    
    Note: When initializing MouseEvent objects using initMouseEvent or
    initMouseEventNS, implementations should use the client coordinates
    clientX and clientY for calculation of other coordinates (such as target
    coordinates exposed by DOM Level 0 implementations).

The Mouse event types are listed below. For a full description of the
semantics associated with these event types, refer to the Complete list of
event types. In the case of nested elements, mouse event types are always
targeted at the most deeply nested element. Ancestors of the targeted element
may use bubbling to obtain notification of mouse events which occur within its
descendent elements.

A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the
DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "MouseEvents" and "3.0"
(respectively) to determine whether or not the Mouse event module is supported
by the implementation. In order to fully support this module, an
implementation must also support the "UIEvents" feature defined in this
specification. For additional information about conformance, please see the
DOM Level 3 Core specification [DOM Level 3 Core]. The DOM Level 3 Mouse
Events module is built on top of the DOM Level 2 Mouse Events [DOM Level 2
Events] module, i.e. a DOM Level 3 Mouse Events implementation where
hasFeature("MouseEvents", "3.0") returns true must also return true when the
version number is "2.0", "" or, null.

type	Context information
click	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, MouseEvent.button, and UIEvent.view are in use. The UIEvent.detail attribute indicates the number of consecutive clicks of a pointing device button during a user action. The attribute value is 1 when the user begins this action and increments by 1 for each click. The notion of consecutive clicks depends on the environment configuration. For example, a "double click" will not happen if there is a long delay between the two clicks, even if the pointing device did not move.
mousedown	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, MouseEvent.button, and UIEvent.view are in use. The UIEvent.detail attribute indicates the number of consecutive clicks, incremented by one, of a pointing device button during a user action. For example, if no click happened before the mousedown, UIEvent.detail will contain the value 1.
mouseup	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, MouseEvent.button, and UIEvent.view are in use. The UIEvent.detail attribute indicates the number of consecutive clicks, incremented by one, of a pointing device button during a user action.
mouseover	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, and UIEvent.view are in use. MouseEvent.relatedTarget indicates the event target a pointing device is exiting.
mousemove	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, and UIEvent.view are in use.
mouseout	MouseEvent.screenX, MouseEvent.screenY, MouseEvent.clientX, MouseEvent.clientY, MouseEvent.altKey, MouseEvent.ctrlKey, MouseEvent.shiftKey, MouseEvent.metaKey, MouseEvent.altGraphKey, and UIEvent.view are in use. MouseEvent.relatedTarget indicates the event target a pointing device is entering.

1.7.4 Keyboard event types

Keyboard events are device dependent, i.e. they rely on the capabilities of
the input devices and how they are mapped in the operating systems. It is
therefore highly recommended to rely on Text events types when dealing with
character input.

Interface KeyboardEvent (introduced in DOM Level 3)

    The KeyboardEvent interface provides specific contextual information
    associated with keyboard devices. Each keyboard event references a key
    using an identifier. Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element
    that has the focus.
    
    The KeyboardEvent interface provides convenient attributes for some
    common modifiers keys: KeyboardEvent.ctrlKey, KeyboardEvent.shiftKey,
    KeyboardEvent.altKey, KeyboardEvent.metaKey. These attributes are
    equivalent to use the method
    KeyboardEvent.getModifierState(keyIdentifierArg) with "Control", "Shift",
    "Alt", or "Meta" respectively.
    
    To create an instance of the KeyboardEvent interface, use the
    DocumentEvent.createEvent("KeyboardEvent") method call.

    Definition group KeyLocationCode

        This set of constants is used to indicate the location of a key on the
        device. In case a DOM implementation wishes to provide a new location
        information, a value different from the following constant values must
        be used.

        Defined Constants

            DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT
                The key activated is in the left key location (there is more
                than one possible location for this key). Example: the left
                Shift key on a PC 101 Key US keyboard.
            DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD
                The key activation originated on the numeric keypad or with a
                virtual key corresponding to the numeric keypad. Example: the
                '1' key on a PC 101 Key US keyboard located on the numeric
                pad.
            DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT
                The key activation is in the right key location (there is more
                than one possible location for this key). Example: the right
                Shift key on a PC 101 Key US keyboard.
            DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD
                The key activation is not distinguished as the left or right
                version of the key, and did not originate from the numeric
                keypad (or did not originate with a virtual key corresponding
                to the numeric keypad). Example: the 'Q' key on a PC 101 Key

1.7.5 Mutation and mutation name event types

The mutation and mutation name event modules are designed to allow
notification of any changes to the structure of a document, including
attribute, text, or name modifications. It may be noted that none of the event
types associated with the modules are designated as cancelable. This stems
from the fact that it is very difficult to make use of existing DOM interfaces
which cause document modifications if any change to the document might or
might not take place due to cancelation of the resulting event. Although this
is still a desired capability, it was decided that it would be better left
until the addition of transactions into the DOM.

Many single modifications of the tree can cause multiple mutation events to be
dispatched. Rather than attempt to specify the ordering of mutation events due
to every possible modification of the tree, the ordering of these events is
left to the implementation.

Interface MutationEvent (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The MutationEvent interface provides specific contextual information
    associated with Mutation events.
    
    To create an instance of the MutationEvent interface, use the
    DocumentEvent.createEvent("MutationEvent") method call.

The event types {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "resize"} and
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "scroll"} implement the UIEvent
interface. All other HTML event types implement at least the basic Event

1.7.7 HTML Events

The HTML event module is composed of events listed in [HTML 4.01] and
additional events which are supported in DOM Level 0 browsers. It refines the
semantics and scope of the basic event types and provides two new event types.
This event module is only applicable if the Document supports the [DOM Level 2
HTML] specification. Use Node.isSupported(feature, version) with the parameter
values "HTML" and "2.0" (respectively) to determine whether or not the
Document node supports the HTML module.

A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the
DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "HTMLEvents" and "3.0"
(respectively) to determine whether or not the HTML event module is supported
by the implementation. In order to fully support this module, an
implementation must also support the "BasicEvents" feature defined in this
specification and the "HTML" feature defined in [DOM Level 2 HTML]. For
additional information about conformance, please see the DOM Level 3 Core
specification [DOM Level 3 Core]. The DOM Level 3 HTML Events module is built
on top of the DOM Level 2 HTML Events [DOM Level 2 Events] module, i.e. a DOM
Level 3 HTML Events implementation where hasFeature("HTMLEvents", "3.0")
returns true must also return true when the version number is "2.0", "" or,
null.

The following descriptions of event types are refinements of the general
descriptions provided in Complete list of event types, with the addition of
the events {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "focus"} and
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "blur"}. All events types are bound to
the namespace URI "http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events" and the following list
only enumerates the local name of the event type.

load
    The DOM implementation finishes loading all content within the BODY
    element, all frames within a FRAMESET, or any resource linked from the
    document.
unload
    The DOM implementation removes a document from a window or frame. This
    event is valid for BODY and FRAMESET elements.
abort
    The page loading is stopped before an image has been allowed to completely
    load. This event applies to OBJECT elements.
error
    An image does not load properly or when an error occurs during script
    execution. This event is valid for OBJECT elements, BODY elements, and
    FRAMESET element.
select
    A user selects some text in a text field either via the user interface or
    via attributes defined in [DOM Level 2 HTML]. This event is valid for
    INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.
change
    A control loses the input focus and its value has been modified since
    gaining focus. This event can occur either via a user interface
    manipulation or the focus() methods and the attributes defined in [DOM
    Level 2 HTML]. This event is valid for INPUT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA
    element.
submit
    A form is submitted either via a button. This event only applies to the
    FORM element. Note that the HTMLFormElement.submit() method defined in
    [DOM Level 2 HTML] does not fire this event type.
reset
    A form is reset either via a button, or the HTMLFormElement.reset() method
    defined in [DOM Level 2 HTML]. This event only applies to the FORM
    element.
resize
    see resize in Complete list of event types.
scroll
    see scroll in Complete list of event types. 
focus
    An element receives focus either via a pointing device, the focus()
    methods defined in [DOM Level 2 HTML], or by tabbing navigation. This
    event is only valid for the following elements: A, AREA, LABEL, INPUT,
    SELECT, TEXTAREA, and BUTTON. This event type is dispatched after the
    event type {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMFocusIn"}.
blur
    An element loses focus either via a pointing device, the blur() methods
    defined in [DOM Level 2 HTML], or by tabbing navigation. This event is
    only valid for the following elements: A, AREA, LABEL, INPUT, SELECT,
    TEXTAREA, and BUTTON. This event type is dispatched after the event type
    {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMFocusOut"}.

The following table provides refinements or additional information on the
event types. Some events will only be dispatched to a specific set of possible
targets, specified using HTML node types.

type	Bubbling phase	Cancelable	Target node types	DOM interface
load	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLDocument, HTMLBodyElement, HTMLFrameSetElement, HTMLObjectElement, HTMLLinkElement, HTMLMetaElement, HTMLScriptElement, HTMLFrameElement, HTMLIFrameElement, HTMLImageElement 	[no changes]
unload	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLDocument, HTMLBodyElement, HTMLFrameSetElement 	[no changes]
abort	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLObjectElement 	[no changes]
error	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLObjectElement, HTMLBodyElement, HTMLFrameSetElement 	[no changes]
select	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLInputElement, HTMLTextAreaElement 	[no changes]
change	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLTextAreaElement 	[no changes]
submit	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLFormElement 	[no changes]
reset	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLFormElement 	[no changes]
resize	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLDocument, HTMLElement 	[no changes]
scroll	[no changes]	[no changes]	HTMLDocument, HTMLElement 	[no changes]
focus	No	No	HTMLAnchorElement, HTMLAreaElement, HTMLLabelElement, HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLtextAreaElement, HTMLButtonElement. 	Event
blur	No	No	HTMLAnchorElement, HTMLAreaElement, HTMLLabelElement, HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLtextAreaElement, HTMLButtonElement. 	Event

The event types {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "focus"} and
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "blur"} may be generated from a user
interface; in that case, the event objects also implements the UIEvent
interface and UIEvent.view is in use.

1.7.7.1 Activation and default actions

The concept of activation ({"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events",
"DOMActivate"}) was introduced in [DOM Level 2 Events] to separate generic
actions from the devices used to activate them. For example, an hyperlink can
be activated using a mouse or a keyboard, and the activation will force the
user agent to follow the link. It is expected that the action of following the
link is done using a default action attached to the hyperlink element. In such
case, the default action of the device event type is to trigger the event type
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"}. Preventing the default
action of a mouse click when the target node is an hyperlink will prevent the
activation. The same approach is made for control elements.

Implementations could react to an event before dispatching it and do changes
on the display and the DOM tree. In such case, if a DOM attribute is changed
before the event is fired, cancelling the device event type will also reverse
the change. A good example is the attribute HTMLInputElement.checked: As
described in [DOM Level 2 HTML], the value of this property may be changed
before the dispatch of the event; the user clicks on the radio button, the
radio button is being checked (or unchecked) on the display, the attribute
HTMLInputElement.checked is changed as well, and then the device event type
{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "click"} is being dispatched. If the
default action of the device event type is prevented, or if the default action
attached to the {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"} event
type is prevented, the property HTMLInputElement.checked will need to be
changed back to its original value.
