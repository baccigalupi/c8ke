1.1 Introduction

XPath 1.0 [XPath 1.0] is becoming an important part of a variety of many
specifications including XForms, XPointer, XSL, XML Query, and so on. It is
also a clear advantage for user applications which use DOM to be able to use
XPath expressions to locate nodes automatically and declaratively.

This specification was created to map between the Document Object Model's
representation of the W3C Information Set and XPath's model to permit XPath
functions to be supplied and results returned within the framework of DOM APIs
in a standard, interoperable way, allowing also for liveness of data, which is
not addressed by the XPath specification but is present in results coming from
the DOM hierarchy. 

1.2 Mapping DOM to XPath

This section presents a mapping between the Document Object Model [DOM Level 2
Core] and the XPath 1.0 [XPath 1.0] model for the purposes of implementing the
APIs. 

1.2.1 Element Nodes

The DOM model uses Element nodes to represent Element Information Items. These
nodes of a document are directly used to represent the elements of an XPath
result. 

1.2.2 Attribute Nodes

The DOM model uses Attr nodes to represent Attribute Information Items of
attribute and namespace attribute properties of Element Information Item. These
nodes have no parent, but have an ownerElement which can be used as XPath
defines an attribute's parent.

XPath 1.0 does not make available the namespace attributes of an element. The
DOM implementation of XPath 1.0 using these defined interfaces never directly
returns Attr nodes of namespace attributes, but returned Element nodes still
contain them. 

1.2.3 Namespace Nodes

The XPath model expects namespace nodes for each in-scope namespace to be
attached to each element. DOM only maintains the namespace attributes instead
of replicating in-scope namespaces on each Element where they are in-scope. The
DOM implementation of XPath produces a new node of type XPATH_NAMESPACE_NODE,
defined in the XPathNamespace interface, to properly preserve identity and
ordering in a way that is compatible with XPath. This node type is only visible
using the XPath evaluation methods.

The set of in-scope namespaces of an element is the default xml namespace
combined with the contributions of namespace attributes of the current and all
ancestor elements. In addition to explicit namespace attributes, any element
has an implicit declaration of its own prefix, if any, or if no prefix then of
the default namespace, which is enforced during namespace serialization, fixup,
and lookup, which must be added to the set of in-scope namespaces when
generating namespace nodes for an element. This causes the set of namespace
nodes to be consistent with serialization, fixup, and lookup of namespaces in
DOM Level 3. 

1.2.4 Text Nodes

The XPath model relies on the XML Information Set [XML Information Set] ands
represents Character Information Items in a single logical text node where DOM
may have multiple fragmented Text nodes due to cdata sections, entity
references, etc. Instead of returning multiple nodes where XPath sees a single
logical text node, only the first non-empty DOM Text or CDATASection node of
any logical XPath text will be returned in the node set. Applications using
XPath in an environment with fragmented text nodes must manually gather the
text of a single logical text node possibly from multiple nodes beginning with
the first Text node or CDATASection node returned by the implementation.

Note: In an attempt to better implement the XML Information Set, DOM Level 3
Core [DOM Level 3 Core] adds the attribute wholeText on the Text interface for
retrieving the whole text for logically-adjacent Text nodes and the method
replaceWholeText for replacing those nodes. 

1.2.5 Entity Reference Nodes

The DOM model may represent Unexpanded Entity Reference Information Items or
may provide the position and URI of expanded entity hierarchies by using
EntityReference nodes. XPath 1.0 does not preserve corresponding information.

Where the node represents an unexpanded entity reference, it is skipped as
dictated by the XPath specifications for all infoset items besides those
specifically processed.

Where there is a hierarchy underneath the node, these nodes are processed as
though they were siblings of the entity reference, as is consistent with the
rest of the DOM specification.

EntityReference nodes found within a DOM hierarchy are never returned as a node
of the result, but returned nodes may contain or be contained within an
EntityReference node. Text may be split partially inside and partially outside
of an EntityReference node, but this is solved by handling Text nodes as
described in the previous section. 

1.2.6 Comment Nodes

The DOM model uses Comment nodes to represent Comment Information Items. These
nodes of a document are directly used to represent the comments of an XPath
result. 

1.2.7 Processing Instruction Nodes

The DOM model uses ProcessingInstruction nodes to represent Processing
Instruction Information Items. These nodes of a document are directly used to
represent the processing instructions of an XPath result. 

1.2.8 Document order

The document order of nodes in the DOM Core has been defined to be compatible
with the XPath document order. The XPath DOM extends the document order of the
DOM Core to include the XPathNamespace nodes. Element nodes occur before their
children. The attribute nodes and namespace nodes of an element occur before
the children of the element. The namespace nodes are defined to occur before
the attribute nodes. The relative order of namespace nodes is
implementation-dependent. The relative order of attribute nodes is
implementation-dependent. The compareTreePosition method on the Node interface
defined in the DOM Core must compare the XPathNamespace nodes using this
extended document order if the XPath DOM module is supported.

Note: It is possible that in future versions of XPath, the order of namespace
nodes or other aspects of document order may change incompatibly. 

1.3 Conformance

This section explains conformance to DOM Level 3 XPath Module.

A DOM implementation must not return true to hasFeature("xpath", "3.0") unless
the implementation conforms to that module. As documented in [DOM Level 3
Core], if a null or empty string is passed in for the second parameter, then
conformance is still required to some version of the DOM XPath Module or false
must be returned.

/******************************************************************************

A conformant implementation is DOM Level 3 XPath must support all the
interfaces as specified in that specification. In addition to implementing the
interfaces in the DOM XPath Module, a conforming implementation must correctly
implement each part of the XPath 1.0 specification when evaluating expressions
including Location Paths, Expressions, the Core Function Library, and the
mapping between DOM and the XPath 1.0 data model described in the DOM Level 3
XPath Module. The XPath id()function must return the corresponding element, if
any, returned by the DOM method Document.getElementById.

After meeting the requirements for conformance, a conforming implementation may
implement additional functions and variables. Applications which evaluate
expressions using these extensions will not necessarily be portable to other
implementations of the DOM Level 3 XPath Module. 

1.4 Interfaces

An implementation is DOM Level 3 XPath conformant if it supports the Core
module defined in [DOM Level 2 Core] and the module defined in this
specification. An implementation conforms to a DOM module if it supports all
the interfaces for that module and the associated semantics.

A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the
DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "XPath" and "3.0"
(respectively) to determine whether or not the XPath module is supported by the
implementation. In order to fully support this module, an implementation must
also support the "Core" feature defined in the DOM Level 2 Core specification
[DOM Level 2 Core].

A DOM implementation must not return true to the hasFeature(feature, version)
method of the DOMImplementation interface for that feature unless the
implementation conforms to that module. The version number for the feature used
in this document is "3.0".

Exception XPathException

    A new exception has been created for exceptions specific to these XPath
    interfaces.

Interface XPathEvaluator

    The evaluation of XPath expressions is provided by XPathEvaluator. In a DOM
    implementation which supports the XPath 3.0 feature, as described above,
    the XPathEvaluator interface will be implemented on the same object which
    implements the Document interface permitting it to be obtained by the usual
    binding-specific method such as casting or by using the DOM Level 3
    getInterface method. In this case the implementation obtained from the
    Document supports the XPath DOM module and is compatible with the XPath 1.0
    specification.
    
     Evaluation of expressions with specialized extension functions or
    variables may not work in all implementations and is, therefore, not
    portable. XPathEvaluator implementations may be available from other
    sources that could provide specific support for specialized extension
    functions or variables as would be defined by other specifications.

            expression of type DOMString
                The XPath expression string to be parsed.
            resolver of type XPathNSResolver
                The resolver permits translation of all prefixes, including the
                xml namespace prefix, within the XPath expression into

    Definition group XPathResultType

        An integer indicating what type of result this is.

        If a specific type is specified, then the result will be returned as
        the corresponding type, using XPath type conversions where required and
        possible.

        Defined Constants

            ANY_TYPE
                This code does not represent a specific type. An evaluation of
                an XPath expression will never produce this type. If this type
                is requested, then the evaluation returns whatever type
                naturally results from evaluation of the expression.

                If the natural result is a node set when ANY_TYPE was
                requested, then UNORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE is always the
                resulting type. Any other representation of a node set must be
                explicitly requested.
            ANY_UNORDERED_NODE_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] and will be
                accessed as a single node, which may be nullif the node set is
                empty. Document modification does not invalidate the node, but
                may mean that the result node no longer corresponds to the
                current document. This is a convenience that permits
                optimization since the implementation can stop once any node in
                the resulting set has been found.

                If there is more than one node in the actual result, the single
                node returned might not be the first in document order.           BOOLEAN_TYPE

                The result is a boolean as defined by [XPath 1.0]. Document
                modification does not invalidate the boolean, but may mean that
                reevaluation would not yield the same boolean.
            FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] and will be
                accessed as a single node, which may be null if the node set is
                empty. Document modification does not invalidate the node, but
                may mean that the result node no longer corresponds to the
                current document. This is a convenience that permits
                optimization since the implementation can stop once the first
                node in document order of the resulting set has been found.

                If there are more than one node in the actual result, the
                single node returned will be the first in document order.
            NUMBER_TYPE
                The result is a number as defined by [XPath 1.0]. Document
                modification does not invalidate the number, but may mean that
                reevaluation would not yield the same number.
            ORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] that will be
                accessed iteratively, which will produce document-ordered
                nodes. Document modification invalidates the iteration.
            ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] that will be
                accessed as a snapshot list of nodes that will be in original
                document order. Document modification does not invalidate the
                snapshot but may mean that reevaluation would not yield the
                same snapshot and nodes in the snapshot may have been altered,
                moved, or removed from the document.
            STRING_TYPE
                The result is a string as defined by [XPath 1.0]. Document
                modification does not invalidate the string, but may mean that
                the string no longer corresponds to the current document.
            UNORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] that will be
                accessed iteratively, which may not produce nodes in a
                particular order. Document modification invalidates the
                iteration.

                This is the default type returned if the result is a node set
                and ANY_TYPE is requested.
            UNORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE
                The result is a node set as defined by [XPath 1.0] that will be
                accessed as a snapshot list of nodes that may not be in a
                particular order. Document modification does not invalidate the
                snapshot but may mean that reevaluation would not yield the
                same snapshot and nodes in the snapshot may have been altered,
                moved, or removed from the document.

Interface XPathNamespace

    The XPathNamespace interface is returned by XPathResult interfaces to
    represent the XPath namespace node type that DOM lacks. There is no public
    constructor for this node type. Attempts to place it into a hierarchy or a
    NamedNodeMap result in a DOMException with the code HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR.
    This node is read only, so methods or setting of attributes that would
    mutate the node result in a DOMException with the code
    NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR.
    
    The core specification describes attributes of the Node interface that are
    different for different node types but does not describe
    XPATH_NAMESPACE_NODE, so here is a description of those attributes for this
    node type. All attributes of Node not described in this section have a null
    or false value.
    
    ownerDocument matches the ownerDocument of the ownerElement even if the
    element is later adopted.
    
    nodeName is always the string "#namespace".
    
    prefix is the prefix of the namespace represented by the node.
    
    localName is the same as prefix.
    
    nodeType is equal to XPATH_NAMESPACE_NODE.
    
    namespaceURI is the namespace URI of the namespace represented by the
    node.
    
    nodeValue is the same as namespaceURI.
    
    adoptNode, cloneNode, and importNode fail on this node type by raising a
    
    DOMException with the code NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR.
    
    Note: In future versions of the XPath specification, the definition of a
    namespace node may be changed incomatibly, in which case incompatible
    changes to field values may be required to implement versions beyond XPath
    1.0.
