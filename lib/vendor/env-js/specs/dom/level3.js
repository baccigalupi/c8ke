This specification defines a set of objects and interfaces for accessing and
manipulating document objects. The functionality specified (the Core
functionality) is sufficient to allow software developers and Web script
authors to access and manipulate parsed HTML [HTML 4.01] and XML [XML 1.0]
content inside conforming products. The DOM Core API also allows creation and
population of a Document object using only DOM API calls. A solution for
loading a Document and saving it persistently is proposed in [DOM Level 3 Load
and Save].

1.1 Overview of the DOM Core Interfaces

1.1.1 The DOM Structure Model

The DOM presents documents as a hierarchy of Node objects that also implement
other, more specialized interfaces. Some types of nodes may have child nodes
of various types, and others are leaf nodes that cannot have anything below
them in the document structure. For XML and HTML, the node types, and which
node types they may have as children, are as follows:

    * Document -- Element (maximum of one), ProcessingInstruction, Comment, 
                  DocumentType (maximum of one)
    * DocumentFragment -- Element, ProcessingInstruction, Comment, Text, 
                          CDATASection, EntityReference
    * DocumentType -- no children
    * EntityReference -- Element, ProcessingInstruction, Comment, Text, 
                         CDATASection, EntityReference
    * Element -- Element, Text, Comment, ProcessingInstruction, CDATASection, 
                 EntityReference
    * Attr -- Text, EntityReference
    * ProcessingInstruction -- no children
    * Comment -- no children
    * Text -- no children
    * CDATASection -- no children
    * Entity -- Element, ProcessingInstruction, Comment, Text, CDATASection, 
                EntityReference
    * Notation -- no children

The DOM also specifies a NodeList interface to handle ordered lists of Nodes,
such as the children of a Node, or the elements returned by the
Element.getElementsByTagNameNS(namespaceURI, localName) method, and also a
NamedNodeMap interface to handle unordered sets of nodes referenced by their
name attribute, such as the attributes of an Element. NodeList and
NamedNodeMap objects in the DOM are live; that is, changes to the underlying
document structure are reflected in all relevant NodeList and NamedNodeMap
objects. For example, if a DOM user gets a NodeList object containing the
children of an Element, then subsequently adds more children to that element
(or removes children, or modifies them), those changes are automatically
reflected in the NodeList, without further action on the user's part.
Likewise, changes to a Node in the tree are reflected in all references to
that Node in NodeList and NamedNodeMap objects.

Finally, the interfaces Text, Comment, and CDATASection all inherit from the
CharacterData interface.

1.1.2 Memory Management

Most of the APIs defined by this specification are interfaces rather than
classes. That means that an implementation need only expose methods with the
defined names and specified operation, not implement classes that correspond
directly to the interfaces. This allows the DOM APIs to be implemented as a
thin veneer on top of legacy applications with their own data structures, or
on top of newer applications with different class hierarchies. This also means
that ordinary constructors (in the Java or C++ sense) cannot be used to create
DOM objects, since the underlying objects to be constructed may have little
relationship to the DOM interfaces. The conventional solution to this in
object-oriented design is to define factory methods that create instances of
objects that implement the various interfaces. Objects implementing some
interface "X" are created by a "createX()" method on the Document interface;
this is because all DOM objects live in the context of a specific Document.

The Core DOM APIs are designed to be compatible with a wide range of
languages, including both general-user scripting languages and the more
challenging languages used mostly by professional programmers. Thus, the DOM
APIs need to operate across a variety of memory management philosophies, from
language bindings that do not expose memory management to the user at all,
through those (notably Java) that provide explicit constructors but provide an
automatic garbage collection mechanism to automatically reclaim unused memory,
to those (especially C/C++) that generally require the programmer to
explicitly allocate object memory, track where it is used, and explicitly free
it for re-use. To ensure a consistent API across these platforms, the DOM does
not address memory management issues at all, but instead leaves these for the
implementation. Neither of the explicit language bindings defined by the DOM
API (for ECMAScript and Java) require any memory management methods, but DOM
bindings for other languages (especially C or C++) may require such support.
These extensions will be the responsibility of those adapting the DOM API to a
specific language, not the DOM Working Group.

1.1.3 Naming Conventions

While it would be nice to have attribute and method names that are short,
informative, internally consistent, and familiar to users of similar APIs, the
names also should not clash with the names in legacy APIs supported by DOM
implementations. Furthermore, both OMG IDL [OMG IDL] and ECMAScript
[ECMAScript] have significant limitations in their ability to disambiguate
names from different namespaces that make it difficult to avoid naming
conflicts with short, familiar names. So, DOM names tend to be long and
descriptive in order to be unique across all environments.

The Working Group has also attempted to be internally consistent in its use of
various terms, even though these may not be common distinctions in other APIs.
For example, the DOM API uses the method name "remove" when the method changes
the structural model, and the method name "delete" when the method gets rid of
something inside the structure model. The thing that is deleted is not
returned. The thing that is removed may be returned, when it makes sense to
return it.

1.1.4 Inheritance vs. Flattened Views of the API

The DOM Core APIs present two somewhat different sets of interfaces to an
XML/HTML document: one presenting an "object oriented" approach with a
hierarchy of inheritance, and a "simplified" view that allows all manipulation
to be done via the Node interface without requiring casts (in Java and other
C-like languages) or query interface calls in COM environments. These
operations are fairly expensive in Java and COM, and the DOM may be used in
performance-critical environments, so we allow significant functionality using
just the Node interface. Because many other users will find the inheritance
hierarchy easier to understand than the "everything is a Node" approach to the
DOM, we also support the full higher-level interfaces for those who prefer a
more object-oriented API.

In practice, this means that there is a certain amount of redundancy in the
API. The Working Group considers the "inheritance" approach the primary view
of the API, and the full set of functionality on Node to be "extra"
functionality that users may employ, but that does not eliminate the need for
methods on other interfaces that an object-oriented analysis would dictate.
(Of course, when the O-O analysis yields an attribute or method that is
identical to one on the Node interface, we don't specify a completely
redundant one.) Thus, even though there is a generic Node.nodeName attribute
on the Node interface, there is still a Element.tagName attribute on the
Element interface; these two attributes must contain the same value, but the
it is worthwhile to support both, given the different constituencies the DOM
API must satisfy.

1.2 Basic Types

To ensure interoperability, this specification specifies the following basic
types used in various DOM modules. Even though the DOM uses the basic types in
the interfaces, bindings may use different types and normative bindings are
only given for Java and ECMAScript in this specification.

1.2.1 The DOMString Type

The DOMString type is used to store [Unicode] characters as a sequence of
16-bit units using UTF-16 as defined in [Unicode] and Amendment 1 of [ISO/IEC
10646].

Characters are fully normalized as defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1] if:

    * the parameter "normalize-characters" was set to true while loading the 
      document or the document was certified as defined in [XML 1.1];
    * the parameter "normalize-characters" was set to true while using the 
      method Document.normalizeDocument(), or while using the method 
      Node.normalize();

Note that, with the exceptions of Document.normalizeDocument() and
Node.normalize(), manipulating characters using DOM methods does not guarantee
to preserve a fully-normalized text.

Type Definition DOMString

    A DOMString is a sequence of 16-bit units.


    IDL Definition

        valuetype DOMString sequence<unsigned short>;


The UTF-16 encoding was chosen because of its widespread industry practice.
Note that for both HTML and XML, the document character set (and therefore the
notation of numeric character references) is based on UCS [ISO/IEC 10646]. A
single numeric character reference in a source document may therefore in some
cases correspond to two 16-bit units in a DOMString (a high surrogate and a
low surrogate). For issues related to string comparisons, refer to String
Comparisons in the DOM.

For Java and ECMAScript, DOMString is bound to the String type because both
languages also use UTF-16 as their encoding.

Note: As of August 2000, the OMG IDL specification ([OMG IDL]) included a
wstring type. However, that definition did not meet the interoperability
criteria of the DOM API since it relied on negotiation to decide the width and
encoding of a character. 

1.2.2 The DOMTimeStamp Type

The DOMTimeStamp type is used to store an absolute or relative time.

Type Definition DOMTimeStamp

    A DOMTimeStamp represents a number of milliseconds.


    IDL Definition

        typedef unsigned long long DOMTimeStamp;


For Java, DOMTimeStamp is bound to the long type. For ECMAScript, DOMTimeStamp
is bound to the Date type because the range of the integer type is too small.

1.2.3 The DOMUserData Type

The DOMUserData type is used to store application data.

Type Definition DOMUserData

    A DOMUserData represents a reference to application data.


    IDL Definition

        typedef any DOMUserData;


For Java, DOMUserData is bound to the Object type. For ECMAScript, DOMUserData
is bound to any type.

1.2.4 The DOMObject Type

The DOMObject type is used to represent an object.

Type Definition DOMObject

    A DOMObject represents an object reference.


    IDL Definition

        typedef Object DOMObject;


For Java and ECMAScript, DOMObject is bound to the Object type.

1.3 General Considerations
1.3.1 String Comparisons in the DOM

The DOM has many interfaces that imply string matching. For XML, string
comparisons are case-sensitive and performed with a binary comparison of the
16-bit units of the DOMStrings. However, for case-insensitive markup
languages, such as HTML 4.01 or earlier, these comparisons are
case-insensitive where appropriate.

Note that HTML processors often perform specific case normalizations
(canonicalization) of the markup before the DOM structures are built. This is
typically using uppercase for element names and lowercase for attribute names.
For this reason, applications should also compare element and attribute names
returned by the DOM implementation in a case-insensitive manner.

The character normalization, i.e. transforming into their fully normalized
form as as defined in [XML 1.1], is assumed to happen at serialization time.
The DOM Level 3 Load and Save module [DOM Level 3 Load and Save] provides a
serialization mechanism (see the DOMSerializer interface, section 2.3.1) and
uses the DOMConfiguration parameters "normalize-characters" and
"check-character-normalization" to assure that text is fully normalized [XML
1.1]. Other serialization mechanisms built on top of the DOM Level 3 Core also
have to assure that text is fully normalized.

1.3.2 DOM URIs

The DOM specification relies on DOMString values as resource identifiers, such
that the following conditions are met:

   1. An absolute identifier absolutely identifies a resource on the Web;
   2. Simple string equality establishes equality of absolute resource
      identifiers, and no other equivalence of resource identifiers is
      considered significant to the DOM specification;
   3. A relative identifier is easily detected and made absolute relative to
      an absolute identifier;
   4. Retrieval of content of a resource may be accomplished where required.

The term "absolute URI" refers to a complete resource identifier and the term
"relative URI" refers to an incomplete resource identifier.

Within the DOM specifications, these identifiers are called URIs, "Uniform
Resource Identifiers", but this is meant abstractly. The DOM implementation
does not necessarily process its URIs according to the URI specification [IETF
RFC 2396]. Generally the particular form of these identifiers must be ignored.

When is not possible to completely ignore the type of a DOM URI, either
because a relative identifier must be made absolute or because content must be
retrieved, the DOM implementation must at least support identifier types
appropriate to the content being processed. [HTML 4.01], [XML 1.0], and
associated namespace specification [XML Namespaces] rely on [IETF RFC 2396] to
determine permissible characters and resolving relative URIs. Other
specifications such as namespaces in XML 1.1 [XML Namespaces 1.1] may rely on
alternative resource identifier types that may, for example, include non-ASCII
characters, necessitating support for alternative resource identifier types
where required by applicable specifications.

1.3.3 XML Namespaces

DOM Level 2 and 3 support XML namespaces [XML Namespaces] by augmenting
several interfaces of the DOM Level 1 Core to allow creating and manipulating
elements and attributes associated to a namespace. When [XML 1.1] is in use
(see Document.xmlVersion), DOM Level 3 also supports [XML Namespaces 1.1].

As far as the DOM is concerned, special attributes used for declaring XML
namespaces are still exposed and can be manipulated just like any other
attribute. However, nodes are permanently bound to namespace URIs as they get
created. Consequently, moving a node within a document, using the DOM, in no
case results in a change of its namespace prefix or namespace URI. Similarly,
creating a node with a namespace prefix and namespace URI, or changing the
namespace prefix of a node, does not result in any addition, removal, or
modification of any special attributes for declaring the appropriate XML
namespaces. Namespace validation is not enforced; the DOM application is
responsible. In particular, since the mapping between prefixes and namespace
URIs is not enforced, in general, the resulting document cannot be serialized
naively. For example, applications may have to declare every namespace in use
when serializing a document.

In general, the DOM implementation (and higher) doesn't perform any URI
normalization or canonicalization. The URIs given to the DOM are assumed to be
valid (e.g., characters such as white spaces are properly escaped), and no
lexical checking is performed. Absolute URI references are treated as strings
and compared literally. How relative namespace URI references are treated is
undefined. To ensure interoperability only absolute namespace URI references
(i.e., URI references beginning with a scheme name and a colon) should be
used. Applications should use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter for
methods if they wish to have no namespace. In programming languages where
empty strings can be differentiated from null, empty strings, when given as a
namespace URI, are converted to null. This is true even though the DOM does no
lexical checking of URIs.

Note: Element.setAttributeNS(null, ...) puts the attribute in the
per-element-type partitions as defined in XML Namespace Partitions in [XML
Namespaces].

Note: In the DOM, all namespace declaration attributes are by definition bound
to the namespace URI: "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/". These are the
attributes whose namespace prefix or qualified name is "xmlns" as introduced
in [XML Namespaces 1.1].

In a document with no namespaces, the child list of an EntityReference node is
always the same as that of the corresponding Entity. This is not true in a
document where an entity contains unbound namespace prefixes. In such a case,
the descendants of the corresponding EntityReference nodes may be bound to
different namespace URIs, depending on where the entity references are. Also,
because, in the DOM, nodes always remain bound to the same namespace URI,
moving such EntityReference nodes can lead to documents that cannot be
serialized. This is also true when the DOM Level 1 method
Document.createEntityReference(name) is used to create entity references that
correspond to such entities, since the descendants of the returned
EntityReference are unbound. While DOM Level 3 does have support for the
resolution of namespace prefixes, use of such entities and entity references
should be avoided or used with extreme care.

The "NS" methods, such as Document.createElementNS(namespaceURI,
qualifiedName) and Document.createAttributeNS(namespaceURI, qualifiedName),
are meant to be used by namespace aware applications. Simple applications that
do not use namespaces can use the DOM Level 1 methods, such as
Document.createElement(tagName) and Document.createAttribute(name). Elements
and attributes created in this way do not have any namespace prefix, namespace
URI, or local name.

Note: DOM Level 1 methods are namespace ignorant. Therefore, while it is safe
to use these methods when not dealing with namespaces, using them and the new
ones at the same time should be avoided. DOM Level 1 methods solely identify
attribute nodes by their Node.nodeName. On the contrary, the DOM Level 2
methods related to namespaces, identify attribute nodes by their
Node.namespaceURI and Node.localName. Because of this fundamental difference,
mixing both sets of methods can lead to unpredictable results. In particular,
using Element.setAttributeNS(namespaceURI, qualifiedName, value), an element
may have two attributes (or more) that have the same Node.nodeName, but
different Node.namespaceURIs. Calling Element.getAttribute(name) with that
nodeName could then return any of those attributes. The result depends on the
implementation. Similarly, using Element.setAttributeNode(newAttr), one can
set two attributes (or more) that have different Node.nodeNames but the same
Node.prefix and Node.namespaceURI. In this case
Element.getAttributeNodeNS(namespaceURI, localName) will return either
attribute, in an implementation dependent manner. The only guarantee in such
cases is that all methods that access a named item by its nodeName will access
the same item, and all methods which access a node by its URI and local name
will access the same node. For instance, Element.setAttribute(name, value) and
Element.setAttributeNS(namespaceURI, qualifiedName, value) affect the node
that Element.getAttribute(name) and Element.getAttributeNS(namespaceURI,
localName), respectively, return.

1.3.4 Base URIs

The DOM Level 3 adds support for the [base URI] property defined in [XML
Information Set] by providing a new attribute on the Node interface that
exposes this information. However, unlike the Node.namespaceURI attribute, the
Node.baseURI attribute is not a static piece of information that every node
carries. Instead, it is a value that is dynamically computed according to [XML
Base]. This means its value depends on the location of the node in the tree
and moving the node from one place to another in the tree may affect its
value. Other changes, such as adding or changing an xml:base attribute on the
node being queried or one of its ancestors may also affect its value.

One consequence of this it that when external entity references are expanded
while building a Document one may need to add, or change, an xml:base
attribute to the Element nodes originally contained in the entity being
expanded so that the Node.baseURI returns the correct value. In the case of
ProcessingInstruction nodes originally contained in the entity being expanded
the information is lost. [DOM Level 3 Load and Save] handles elements as
described here and generates a warning in the latter case.

1.3.5 Mixed DOM Implementations

As new XML vocabularies are developed, those defining the vocabularies are
also beginning to define specialized APIs for manipulating XML instances of
those vocabularies. This is usually done by extending the DOM to provide
interfaces and methods that perform operations frequently needed by their
users. For example, the MathML [MathML 2.0] and SVG [SVG 1.1] specifications
have developed DOM extensions to allow users to manipulate instances of these
vocabularies using semantics appropriate to images and mathematics,
respectively, as well as the generic DOM XML semantics. Instances of SVG or
MathML are often embedded in XML documents conforming to a different schema
such as XHTML.

While the Namespaces in XML specification [XML Namespaces] provides a
mechanism for integrating these documents at the syntax level, it has become
clear that the DOM Level 2 Recommendation [DOM Level 2 Core] is not rich
enough to cover all the issues that have been encountered in having these
different DOM implementations be used together in a single application. DOM
Level 3 deals with the requirements brought about by embedding fragments
written according to a specific markup language (the embedded component) in a
document where the rest of the markup is not written according to that
specific markup language (the host document). It does not deal with fragments
embedded by reference or linking.

A DOM implementation supporting DOM Level 3 Core should be able to collaborate
with subcomponents implementing specific DOMs to assemble a compound document
that can be traversed and manipulated via DOM interfaces as if it were a
seamless whole.

The normal typecast operation on an object should support the interfaces
expected by legacy code for a given document type. Typecasting techniques may
not be adequate for selecting between multiple DOM specializations of an
object which were combined at run time, because they may not all be part of
the same object as defined by the binding's object model. Conflicts are most
obvious with the Document object, since it is shared as owner by the rest of
the document. In a homogeneous document, elements rely on the Document for
specialized services and construction of specialized nodes. In a heterogeneous
document, elements from different modules expect different services and APIs
from the same Document object, since there can only be one owner and root of
the document hierarchy.

1.3.6 DOM Features

Each DOM module defines one or more features, as listed in the conformance
section (Conformance). Features are case-insensitive and are also defined for
a specific set of versions. For example, this specification defines the
features "Core" and "XML", for the version "3.0". Versions "1.0" and "2.0" can
also be used for features defined in the corresponding DOM Levels. To avoid
possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring to features defined
outside the DOM specification should be made unique. Applications could then
request for features to be supported by a DOM implementation using the methods
DOMImplementationSource.getDOMImplementation(features) or
DOMImplementationSource.getDOMImplementationList(features), check the features
supported by a DOM implementation using the method
DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version), or by a specific node using
Node.isSupported(feature, version). Note that when using the methods that take
a feature and a version as parameters, applications can use null or empty
string for the version parameter if they don't wish to specify a particular
version for the specified feature.

Up to the DOM Level 2 modules, all interfaces, that were an extension of
existing ones, were accessible using binding-specific casting mechanisms if
the feature associated to the extension was supported. For example, an
instance of the EventTarget interface could be obtained from an instance of
the Node interface if the feature "Events" was supported by the node.

As discussed Mixed DOM Implementations, DOM Level 3 Core should be able to
collaborate with subcomponents implementing specific DOMs. For that effect,
the methods DOMImplementation.getFeature(feature, version) and
Node.getFeature(feature, version) were introduced. In the case of
DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version) and Node.isSupported(feature,
version), if a plus sign "+" is prepended to any feature name, implementations
are considered in which the specified feature may not be directly castable but
would require discovery through DOMImplementation.getFeature(feature, version)
and Node.getFeature(feature, version). Without a plus, only features whose
interfaces are directly castable are considered.

// example 1, without prepending the "+"
if (myNode.isSupported("Events", "3.0")) {
    EventTarget evt = (EventTarget) myNode;
    // ...
}
// example 2, with the "+"
if (myNode.isSupported("+Events", "3.0")) {
    // (the plus sign "+" is irrelevant for the getFeature method itself
    // and is ignored by this method anyway)
    EventTarget evt = (EventTarget) myNode.getFeature("Events", "3.0");
    // ...
}

1.3.7 Bootstrapping

Because previous versions of the DOM specification only defined a set of
interfaces, applications had to rely on some implementation dependent code to
start from. However, hard-coding the application to a specific implementation
prevents the application from running on other implementations and from using
the most-suitable implementation of the environment. At the same time,
implementations may also need to load modules or perform other setup to
efficiently adapt to different and sometimes mutually-exclusive feature sets.

To solve these problems this specification introduces a
DOMImplementationRegistry object with a function that lets an application find
implementations, based on the specific features it requires. How this object
is found and what it exactly looks like is not defined here, because this
cannot be done in a language-independent manner. Instead, each language
binding defines its own way of doing this. See Java Language Binding and
ECMAScript Language Binding for specifics.

In all cases, though, the DOMImplementationRegistry provides a
getDOMImplementation method accepting a features string, which is passed to
every known DOMImplementationSource until a suitable DOMImplementation is
found and returned. The DOMImplementationRegistry also provides a
getDOMImplementationList method accepting a features string, which is passed
to every known DOMImplementationSource, and returns a list of suitable
DOMImplementations. Those two methods are the same as the ones found on the
DOMImplementationSource interface.

Any number of DOMImplementationSource objects can be registered. A source may
return one or more DOMImplementation singletons or construct new
DOMImplementation objects, depending upon whether the requested features
require specialized state in the DOMImplementation object.

1.4 Fundamental Interfaces: Core Module

The interfaces within this section are considered fundamental, and must be
fully implemented by all conforming implementations of the DOM, including all
HTML DOM implementations [DOM Level 2 HTML], unless otherwise specified.

A DOM application may use the DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)
method with parameter values "Core" and "3.0" (respectively) to determine
whether or not this module is supported by the implementation. Any
implementation that conforms to DOM Level 3 or a DOM Level 3 module must
conform to the Core module. Please refer to additional information about
conformance in this specification. The DOM Level 3 Core module is backward
compatible with the DOM Level 2 Core [DOM Level 2 Core] module, i.e. a DOM
Level 3 Core implementation who returns true for "Core" with the version
number "3.0" must also return true for this feature when the version number is
"2.0", "" or, null.

Exception DOMException

    DOM operations only raise exceptions in "exceptional" circumstances, i.e., 
    when an operation is impossible to perform (either for logical reasons, 
    because data is lost, or because the implementation has become unstable). 
    In general, DOM methods return specific error values in ordinary processing
    situations, such as out-of-bound errors when using NodeList.

    Implementations should raise other exceptions under other circumstances. 
    For example, implementations should raise an implementation-dependent 
    exception if a null argument is passed when null was not expected.

    Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of exceptions.
    For such systems, error conditions may be indicated using native error 
    reporting mechanisms. For some bindings, for example, methods may return 
    error codes similar to those listed in the corresponding method 
    descriptions.

    Methods

        createDocument introduced in DOM Level 2
            Creates a DOM Document object of the specified type with its 
            document element.
            
            Note that based on the DocumentType given to create the document, 
            the implementation may instantiate specialized Document objects 
            that support additional features than the "Core", such as "HTML" 
            [DOM Level 2 HTML]. On the other hand, setting the DocumentType 
            after the document was created makes this very unlikely to happen. 
            Alternatively, specialized Document creation methods, such as 
            createHTMLDocument [DOM Level 2 HTML], can be used to obtain 
            specific types of Document objects.
            
            Parameters

            namespaceURI of type DOMString
                The namespace URI of the document element to create or null.
            qualifiedName of type DOMString
                The qualified name of the document element to be created or 
                null.
            doctype of type DocumentType
                The type of document to be created or null.
                When doctype is not null, its Node.ownerDocument attribute is 
                set to the document being created.

            Return Value

            Document

            A new Document object with its document element. If the 
            NamespaceURI, qualifiedName, and doctype are null, the returned 
            Document is empty with no document element.

            DOMException

            INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified qualified name is 
            not an XML name according to [XML 1.0].

            NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the qualifiedName is malformed, if the 
            qualifiedName has a prefix and the namespaceURI is null, or if the 
            qualifiedName is null and the namespaceURI is different from null,

            non-null namespace URI was provided, since namespaces were defined 
            by XML.

            WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if doctype has already been used with a 
            different document or was created from a different implementation.

            NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not

Interface DocumentFragment

    DocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal" Document object. It is 
    very common to want to be able to extract a portion of a document's tree 
    or to create a new fragment of a document. Imagine implementing a user 
    command like cut or rearranging a document by moving fragments around. It 
    is desirable to have an object which can hold such fragments and it is 
    quite natural to use a Node for this purpose. While it is true that a 
    Document object could fulfill this role, a Document object can potentially 
    be a heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What 
    is really needed for this is a very lightweight object. DocumentFragment 
    is such an object.

    Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children of 
    another Node -- may take DocumentFragment objects as arguments; this 
    results in all the child nodes of the DocumentFragment being moved to the 
    child list of this node.

    The children of a DocumentFragment node are zero or more nodes representing 
    the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the document. 
    DocumentFragment nodes do not need to be well-formed XML documents (although 
    they do need to follow the rules imposed upon well-formed XML parsed 
    entities, which can have multiple top nodes). For example, a 
    DocumentFragment might have only one child and that child node could be a 
    Text node. Such a structure model represents neither an HTML document nor 
    a well-formed XML document.

    When a DocumentFragment is inserted into a Document (or indeed any other
    Node that may take children) the children of the DocumentFragment and not
    the DocumentFragment itself are inserted into the Node. This makes the
    DocumentFragment very useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are
    siblings; the DocumentFragment acts as the parent of these nodes so that
    the user can use the standard methods from the Node interface, such as
    Node.insertBefore and Node.appendChild.

Interface Document

    The Document interface represents the entire HTML or XML document.
    Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides the
    primary access to the document's data.
    
    Since elements, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, etc.
    cannot exist outside the context of a Document, the Document interface
    also contains the factory methods needed to create these objects. The Node
    objects created have a ownerDocument attribute which associates them with

    Methods

        adoptNode introduced in DOM Level 3
            Attempts to adopt a node from another document to this document.
            If supported, it changes the ownerDocument of the source node, its
            children, as well as the attached attribute nodes if there are
            any. If the source node has a parent it is first removed from the
            child list of its parent. This effectively allows moving a subtree
            from one document to another (unlike importNode() which create a
            copy of the source node instead of moving it). When it fails,
            applications should use Document.importNode() instead. Note that
            if the adopted node is already part of this document (i.e. the
            source and target document are the same), this method still has
            the effect of removing the source node from the child list of its
            parent, if any. The following list describes the specifics for
            each type of node.

            ATTRIBUTE_NODE
                The ownerElement attribute is set to null and the specified
                flag is set to true on the adopted Attr. The descendants of
                the source Attr are recursively adopted.
            DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE
                The descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.
            DOCUMENT_NODE
                Document nodes cannot be adopted.
            DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
                DocumentType nodes cannot be adopted.
            ELEMENT_NODE
                Specified attribute nodes of the source element are adopted.
                Default attributes are discarded, though if the document being
                adopted into defines default attributes for this element name,
                those are assigned. The descendants of the source element are
                recursively adopted.
            ENTITY_NODE
                Entity nodes cannot be adopted.
            ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE
                Only the EntityReference node itself is adopted, the
                descendants are discarded, since the source and destination
                documents might have defined the entity differently. If the
                document being imported into provides a definition for this
                entity name, its value is assigned.
            NOTATION_NODE
                Notation nodes cannot be adopted.
            PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE, 
            COMMENT_NODE
                These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

            Note: Since it does not create new nodes unlike the
            Document.importNode() method, this method does not raise an
            INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception, and applications should use the
            Document.normalizeDocument() method to check if an imported name
            is not an XML name according to the XML version in use.

            Parameters

            source of type Node
                The node to move into this document.

            Return Value

            Node

            this method creates a new copy of the source node. The returned
            node has no parent; (parentNode is null).

            For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
            importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
            node's nodeName and nodeType, plus the attributes related to
            namespaces (prefix, localName, and namespaceURI). As in the
            cloneNode operation, the source node is not altered. User data
            associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if
            any UserDataHandlers has been specified along with the associated
            data these handlers will be called with the appropriate parameters
            before this method returns.

            Additional information is copied as appropriate to the nodeType,
            attempting to mirror the behavior expected if a fragment of XML or
            HTML source was copied from one document to another, recognizing
            that the two documents may have different DTDs in the XML case.
            The following list describes the specifics for each type of node.

            ATTRIBUTE_NODE
                The ownerElement attribute is set to null and the specified
                flag is set to true on the generated Attr. The descendants of
                the source Attr are recursively imported and the resulting
                nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.

                Note that the deep parameter has no effect on Attr nodes; they
                always carry their children with them when imported.
            DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE
                If the deep option was set to true, the descendants of the
                source DocumentFragment are recursively imported and the
                resulting nodes reassembled under the imported
                DocumentFragment to form the corresponding subtree. Otherwise,
                this simply generates an empty DocumentFragment.
            DOCUMENT_NODE
                Document nodes cannot be imported.
            DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
                DocumentType nodes cannot be imported.
            ELEMENT_NODE
                Specified attribute nodes of the source element are imported,
                and the generated Attr nodes are attached to the generated
                Element. Default attributes are not copied, though if the
                document being imported into defines default attributes for
                this element name, those are assigned. If the importNode deep
                parameter was set to true, the descendants of the source
                element are recursively imported and the resulting nodes
                reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
            ENTITY_NODE
                Entity nodes can be imported, however in the current release
                of the DOM the DocumentType is readonly. Ability to add these
                imported nodes to a DocumentType will be considered for
                addition to a future release of the DOM.

                On import, the publicId, systemId, and notationName attributes
                are copied. If a deep import is requested, the descendants of
                the the source Entity are recursively imported and the
                resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
            ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE
                Only the EntityReference itself is copied, even if a deep
                import is requested, since the source and destination
                documents might have defined the entity differently. If the
                document being imported into provides a definition for this
                entity name, its value is assigned.
            NOTATION_NODE
                Notation nodes can be imported, however in the current release
                of the DOM the DocumentType is readonly. Ability to add these
                imported nodes to a DocumentType will be considered for
                addition to a future release of the DOM.

                On import, the publicId and systemId attributes are copied.

                Note that the deep parameter has no effect on this type of

            PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE
                The imported node copies its target and data values from those
                of the source node.

                Note that the deep parameter has no effect on this type of

            TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE
                These three types of nodes inheriting from CharacterData copy
                their data and length attributes from those of the source

            Parameters

            importedNode of type Node
                The node to import.
            deep of type boolean
                If true, recursively import the subtree under the specified
                node; if false, import only the node itself, as explained
                above. This has no effect on nodes that cannot have any
                children, and on Attr, and EntityReference nodes.

            Return Value

            Node
            	

            The imported node that belongs to this Document.

            This method acts as if the document was going through a save and
            load cycle, putting the document in a "normal" form. As a
            consequence, this method updates the replacement tree of
            EntityReference nodes and normalizes Text nodes, as defined in the
            method Node.normalize().

            Otherwise, the actual result depends on the features being set on
            the Document.domConfig object and governing what operations
            actually take place. Noticeably this method could also make the
            document namespace well-formed according to the algorithm
            described in Namespace Normalization, check the character
            normalization, remove the CDATASection nodes, etc. See
            DOMConfiguration for details.

            // Keep in the document the information defined
            // in the XML Information Set (Java example)
            DOMConfiguration docConfig = myDocument.getDomConfig();
            docConfig.setParameter("infoset", Boolean.TRUE);
            myDocument.normalizeDocument();


            Mutation events, when supported, are generated to reflect the
            changes occurring on the document.

            If errors occur during the invocation of this method, such as an
            attempt to update a read-only node or a Node.nodeName contains an
            invalid character according to the XML version in use, errors or
            warnings (DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR or DOMError.SEVERITY_WARNING)
            will be reported using the DOMErrorHandler object associated with
            the "error-handler" parameter. Note this method might also report
            fatal errors (DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR) if an implementation
            cannot recover from an error.

        renameNode introduced in DOM Level 3
            Rename an existing node of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE.
            
            When possible this simply changes the name of the given node,
            otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and
            replaces the existing node with the new node as described below.
            
            If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible,
            the following operations are performed: a new node is created, any
            registered event listener is registered on the new node, any user
            data attached to the old node is removed from that node, the old
            node is removed from its parent if it has one, the children are
            moved to the new node, if the renamed node is an Element its
            attributes are moved to the new node, the new node is inserted at
            the position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes
            list if it has one, the user data that was attached to the old
            node is attached to the new node.
            
            When the node being renamed is an Element only the specified
            attributes are moved, default attributes originated from the DTD
            are updated according to the new element name. In addition, the
            implementation may update default attributes from other schemas.
            Applications should use Document.normalizeDocument() to guarantee
            these attributes are up-to-date.
            
            When the node being renamed is an Attr that is attached to an
            Element, the node is first removed from the Element attributes
            map. Then, once renamed, either by modifying the existing node or
            creating a new one as described above, it is put back.

            In addition,

                * a user data event NODE_RENAMED is fired,
                * when the implementation supports the feature
                  "MutationNameEvents", each mutation operation involved in
                  this method fires the appropriate event, and in the end the
                  event {http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events,
                  DOMElementNameChanged} or

Interface Node

    The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document Object
    Model. It represents a single node in the document tree. While all objects
    implementing the Node interface expose methods for dealing with children,
    not all objects implementing the Node interface may have children. For
    example, Text nodes may not have children, and adding children to such
    nodes results in a DOMException being raised.
    
    The attributes nodeName, nodeValue and attributes are included as a
    mechanism to get at node information without casting down to the specific
    derived interface. In cases where there is no obvious mapping of these
    attributes for a specific nodeType (e.g., nodeValue for an Element or
    attributes for a Comment), this returns null. Note that the specialized
    interfaces may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get
    and set the relevant information.

    Definition group DocumentPosition

        A bitmask indicating the relative document position of a node with
        respect to another node.
        
         If the two nodes being compared are the same node, then no flags are
        set on the return.
        
         Otherwise, the order of two nodes is determined by looking for common
        containers -- containers which contain both. A node directly contains
        any child nodes. A node also directly contains any other nodes
        attached to it such as attributes contained in an element or entities
        and notations contained in a document type. Nodes contained in
        contained nodes are also contained, but less-directly as the number of
        intervening containers increases.
        
         If there is no common container node, then the order is based upon
        order between the root container of each node that is in no container.
        In this case, the result is disconnected and implementation-specific.
        This result is stable as long as these outer-most containing nodes
        remain in memory and are not inserted into some other containing node.
        This would be the case when the nodes belong to different documents or
        fragments, and cloning the document or inserting a fragment might
        change the order.
        
         If one of the nodes being compared contains the other node, then the
        container precedes the contained node, and reversely the contained
        node follows the container. For example, when comparing an element
        against its own attribute or child, the element node precedes its
        attribute node and its child node, which both follow it.
        
         If neither of the previous cases apply, then there exists a
        most-direct container common to both nodes being compared. In this
        case, the order is determined based upon the two determining nodes
        directly contained in this most-direct common container that either
        are or contain the corresponding nodes being compared.
        
         If these two determining nodes are both child nodes, then the natural
        DOM order of these determining nodes within the containing node is
        returned as the order of the corresponding nodes. This would be the
        case, for example, when comparing two child elements of the same
        element.
        
         If one of the two determining nodes is a child node and the other is
        not, then the corresponding node of the child node follows the
        corresponding node of the non-child node. This would be the case, for
        example, when comparing an attribute of an element with a child
        element of the same element.
        
         If neither of the two determining node is a child node and one
        determining node has a greater value of nodeType than the other, then
        the corresponding node precedes the other. This would be the case, for
        example, when comparing an entity of a document type against a
        notation of the same document type.
        
         If neither of the two determining node is a child node and nodeType
        is the same for both determining nodes, then an
        implementation-dependent order between the determining nodes is
        returned. This order is stable as long as no nodes of the same
        nodeType are inserted into or removed from the direct container. This
        would be the case, for example, when comparing two attributes of the
        same element, and inserting or removing additional attributes might
        change the order between existing attributes.

            DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY
                The node is contained by the reference node. A node which is
                contained is always following, too.
            DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS
                The node contains the reference node. A node which contains is
                always preceding, too.
            DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED
                The two nodes are disconnected. Order between disconnected
                nodes is always implementation-specific.
            DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING
                The node follows the reference node.
            DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC
                The determination of preceding versus following is
                implementation-specific.
            DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING

        parentNode of type Node, readonly
            The parent of this node. All nodes, except Attr, Document,

            The namespace prefix of this node, or null if it is unspecified.
            When it is defined to be null, setting it has no effect, including
            if the node is read-only.

            when applicable.

             Cloning an Element copies all attributes and their values,
            including those generated by the XML processor to represent

            it contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text
            contained in an the Element since the text is contained in a child
            Text node. Cloning an Attr directly, as opposed to be cloned as
            part of an Element cloning operation, returns a specified

            children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this
            is a deep clone or not. Cloning an EntityReference automatically
            constructs its subtree if a corresponding Entity is available, no
            matter whether this is a deep clone or not. Cloning any other type
            of node simply returns a copy of this node.
            
             Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy,
            but the children of an EntityReference clone are readonly. In
            addition, clones of unspecified Attr nodes are specified. And,
            cloning Document, DocumentType, Entity, and Notation nodes is

        isEqualNode introduced in DOM Level 3
            Tests whether two nodes are equal.

            This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e.,
            whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can
            be tested with Node.isSameNode(). All nodes that are the same will
            also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

            Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are
            satisfied:

                * The two nodes are of the same type.
                * The following string attributes are equal: nodeName,
                  localName, namespaceURI, prefix, nodeValue. This is: they
                  are both null, or they have the same length and are
                  character for character identical.
                * The attributes NamedNodeMaps are equal. This is: they are
                  both null, or they have the same length and for each node
                  that exists in one map there is a node that exists in the
                  other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same
                  index.
                * The childNodes NodeLists are equal. This is: they are both
                  null, or they have the same length and contain equal nodes
                  at the same index. Note that normalization can affect
                  equality; to avoid this, nodes should be normalized before
                  being compared.


            For two DocumentType nodes to be equal, the following conditions
            must also be satisfied:

                * The following string attributes are equal: publicId,
                  systemId, internalSubset.
                * The entities NamedNodeMaps are equal.
                * The notations NamedNodeMaps are equal.


            On the other hand, the following do not affect equality: the
            ownerDocument, baseURI, and parentNode attributes, the specified
            attribute for Attr nodes, the schemaTypeInfo attribute for Attr
            and Element nodes, the Text.isElementContentWhitespace attribute
            for Text nodes, as well as any user data or event listeners
            registered on the nodes.

            Note: As a general rule, anything not mentioned in the description
            above is not significant in consideration of equality checking.
            Note that future versions of this specification may take into
            account more attributes and implementations conform to this
            specification are expected to be updated accordingly.

            Parameters

            arg of type Node
                The node to compare equality with.

            Return Value

        removeNamedItemNS introduced in DOM Level 2
            Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI. A
            removed attribute may be known to have a default value when this
            map contains the attributes attached to an element, as returned by
            the attributes attribute of the Node interface. If so, an
            attribute immediately appears containing the default value as well
            as the corresponding namespace URI, local name, and prefix when
            applicable.

            Per [XML Namespaces], applications must use the value null as the
            namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no
            namespace.

            Parameters

            namespaceURI of type DOMString
                The namespace URI of the node to remove.

                The local name of the node to remove.

            Return Value

            Node
            	

            The node removed from this map if a node with such a local name

Interface CharacterData

    The CharacterData interface extends Node with a set of attributes and
    methods for accessing character data in the DOM. For clarity this set is
    defined here rather than on each object that uses these attributes and
    methods. No DOM objects correspond directly to CharacterData, though Text
    and others do inherit the interface from it. All offsets in this interface
    start from 0.
    
    As explained in the DOMString interface, text strings in the DOM are
    represented in UTF-16, i.e. as a sequence of 16-bit units. In the
    following, the term 16-bit units is used whenever necessary to indicate
    that indexing on CharacterData is done in 16-bit units.

 /******************************************************************************

Interface Attr

    The Attr interface represents an attribute in an Element object. Typically
    the allowable values for the attribute are defined in a schema associated
    with the document.
    
     Attr objects inherit the Node interface, but since they are not actually
    child nodes of the element they describe, the DOM does not consider them
    part of the document tree. Thus, the Node attributes parentNode,
    previousSibling, and nextSibling have a null value for Attr objects. The
    DOM takes the view that attributes are properties of elements rather than
    having a separate identity from the elements they are associated with;
    this should make it more efficient to implement such features as default
    attributes associated with all elements of a given type. Furthermore, Attr
    nodes may not be immediate children of a DocumentFragment. However, they
    can be associated with Element nodes contained within a DocumentFragment.
    In short, users and implementors of the DOM need to be aware that Attr
    nodes have some things in common with other objects inheriting the Node
    interface, but they also are quite distinct.
    
     The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this
    attribute has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the
    attribute's effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for this
    attribute, and that declaration includes a default value, then that
    default value is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, the attribute
    does not exist on this element in the structure model until it has been
    explicitly added. Note that the Node.nodeValue attribute on the Attr
    instance can also be used to retrieve the string version of the
    attribute's value(s).
    
     If the attribute was not explicitly given a value in the instance
    document but has a default value provided by the schema associated with
    the document, an attribute node will be created with specified set to
    false. Removing attribute nodes for which a default value is defined in
    the schema generates a new attribute node with the default value and
    specified set to false. If validation occurred while invoking
    Document.normalizeDocument(), attribute nodes with specified equals to
    false are recomputed according to the default attribute values provided by
    the schema. If no default value is associate with this attribute in the
    schema, the attribute node is discarded.
    
     In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity references,
    the child nodes of the Attr node may be either Text or EntityReference
    nodes (when these are in use; see the description of EntityReference for
    discussion).
    
     The DOM Core represents all attribute values as simple strings, even if
    the DTD or schema associated with the document declares them of some
    specific type such as tokenized.
    
     The way attribute value normalization is performed by the DOM
    implementation depends on how much the implementation knows about the
    schema in use. Typically, the value and nodeValue attributes of an Attr
    node initially returns the normalized value given by the parser. It is
    also the case after Document.normalizeDocument() is called (assuming the
    right options have been set). But this may not be the case after mutation,
    independently of whether the mutation is performed by setting the string
    value directly or by changing the Attr child nodes. In particular, this is
    true when character references are involved, given that they are not
    represented in the DOM and they impact attribute value normalization. On
    the other hand, if the implementation knows about the schema in use when
    the attribute value is changed, and it is of a different type than CDATA,
    it may normalize it again at that time. This is especially true of
    specialized DOM implementations, such as SVG DOM implementations, which
    store attribute values in an internal form different from a string.
    
     The following table gives some examples of the relations between the
    attribute value in the original document (parsed attribute), the value as
    exposed in the DOM, and the serialization of the value:

    Examples	Parsed attribute value	Initial Attr.value	Serialized attribute value

                  Element.setIdAttributeNS(), or Element.setIdAttributeNode(),
                  i.e. it is an user-determined ID attribute;

                  Note: XPointer framework (see section 3.2 in [XPointer])
                  consider the DOM user-determined ID attribute as being part
                  of the XPointer externally-determined ID definition.
                * using mechanisms that are outside the scope of this
                  specification, it is then an externally-determined ID
                  attribute. This includes using schema languages different
                  from XML schema and DTD.


            If validation occurred while invoking
            Document.normalizeDocument(), all user-determined ID attributes
            are reset and all attribute nodes ID information are then
            reevaluated in accordance to the schema used. As a consequence, if
            the Attr.schemaTypeInfo attribute contains an ID type, isId will
            always return true.
        name of type DOMString, readonly
            Returns the name of this attribute. If Node.localName is different
            from null, this attribute is a qualified name.
        ownerElement of type Element, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 2
            The Element node this attribute is attached to or null if this
            attribute is not in use.
        schemaTypeInfo of type TypeInfo, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 3
            The type information associated with this attribute. While the
            type information contained in this attribute is guarantee to be
            correct after loading the document or invoking
            Document.normalizeDocument(), schemaTypeInfo may not be reliable
            if the node was moved.
        specified of type boolean, readonly
            True if this attribute was explicitly given a value in the
            instance document, false otherwise. If the application changed the
            value of this attribute node (even if it ends up having the same
            value as the default value) then it is set to true. The
            implementation may handle attributes with default values from
            other schemas similarly but applications should use
            Document.normalizeDocument() to guarantee this information is
            up-to-date.
        value of type DOMString
            On retrieval, the value of the attribute is returned as a string.
            Character and general entity references are replaced with their
            values. See also the method getAttribute on the Element interface.
            
             On setting, this creates a Text node with the unparsed contents
            of the string, i.e. any characters that an XML processor would
            recognize as markup are instead treated as literal text. See also
            the method Element.setAttribute().
            
             Some specialized implementations, such as some [SVG 1.1]
            implementations, may do normalization automatically, even after
            mutation; in such case, the value on retrieval may differ from the
            value on setting.

Interface Element

    The Element interface represents an element in an HTML or XML document.
    Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the Element
    interface inherits from Node, the generic Node interface attribute
    attributes may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an
    element. There are methods on the Element interface to retrieve either an
    Attr object by name or an attribute value by name. In XML, where an
    attribute value may contain entity references, an Attr object should be
    retrieved to examine the possibly fairly complex sub-tree representing the
    attribute value. On the other hand, in HTML, where all attributes have
    simple string values, methods to directly access an attribute value can
    safely be used as a convenience.
    
    Note: In DOM Level 2, the method normalize is inherited from the Node
    interface where it was moved.

Interface Text

    The Text interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the textual
    content (termed character data in XML) of an Element or Attr. If there is
    no markup inside an element's content, the text is contained in a single
    object implementing the Text interface that is the only child of the
    element. If there is markup, it is parsed into the information items
    (elements, comments, etc.) and Text nodes that form the list of children
    of the element.
    
     When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one
    Text node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent Text nodes
    that represent the contents of a given element without any intervening
    markup, but should be aware that there is no way to represent the
    separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they will not (in
    general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The Node.normalize() method
    merges any such adjacent Text objects into a single node for each block of
    text.
    
     No lexical check is done on the content of a Text node and, depending on
    its position in the document, some characters must be escaped during
    serialization using character references; e.g. the characters "<&" if the
    textual content is part of an element or of an attribute, the character
    sequence "]]>" when part of an element, the quotation mark character " or
    the apostrophe character ' when part of an attribute.

        replaceWholeText introduced in DOM Level 3

            nodes are removed including the current node unless it was the
            recipient of the replacement text.

            This method returns the node which received the replacement text.
            The returned node is:

                * null, when the replacement text is the empty string;
                * the current node, except when the current node is read-only;
                * a new Text node of the same type (Text or CDATASection) as
                  the current node inserted at the location of the
                  replacement.


            For instance, in the above example calling replaceWholeText on the

            following:

            Figure: barTextNode.replaceWholeText("yo") modifies the textual
            content of barTextNode with "yo" [SVG 1.0 version]

            Where the nodes to be removed are read-only descendants of an
            EntityReference, the EntityReference must be removed instead of
            the read-only nodes. If any EntityReference to be removed has
            descendants that are not EntityReference, Text, or CDATASection
            nodes, the replaceWholeText method must fail before performing any
            modification of the document, raising a DOMException with the code
            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR.

            For instance, in the example below calling replaceWholeText on the
            Text node that contains "bar" fails, because the EntityReference
            node "ent" contains an Element node which cannot be removed.

Interface TypeInfo (introduced in DOM Level 3)

    The TypeInfo interface represents a type referenced from Element or Attr
    nodes, specified in the schemas associated with the document. The type is
    a pair of a namespace URI and name properties, and depends on the
    document's schema.
    
    If the document's schema is an XML DTD [XML 1.0], the values are computed
    as follows:

        * If this type is referenced from an Attr node, typeNamespace is
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml" and typeName represents the
          [attribute type] property in the [XML Information Set]. If there is

    If the document's schema is an XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1], the values

    contributions (also called PSVI contributions):

        * If the [validity] property exists AND is "invalid" or "notKnown":
          the {target namespace} and {name} properties of the declared type if
          available, otherwise null.

          Note: At the time of writing, the XML Schema specification does not
          require exposing the declared type. Thus, DOM implementations might
          choose not to provide type information if validity is not valid.
        * If the [validity] property exists and is "valid":
             1. If [member type definition] exists:
                   1. If {name} is not absent, then expose {name} and {target
                      namespace} properties of the [member type definition]
                      property;
                   2. Otherwise, expose the namespace and local name of the
                      corresponding anonymous type name.
             2. If the [type definition] property exists:
                   1. If {name} is not absent, then expose {name} and {target
                      namespace} properties of the [type definition] property;
                   2. Otherwise, expose the namespace and local name of the
                      corresponding anonymous type name.
             3. If the [member type definition anonymous] exists:
                   1. If it is false, then expose [member type definition
                      name] and [member type definition namespace] properties;
                   2. Otherwise, expose the namespace and local name of the
                      corresponding anonymous type name.
             4. If the [type definition anonymous] exists:
                   1. If it is false, then expose [type definition name] and
                      [type definition namespace] properties;
                   2. Otherwise, expose the namespace and local name of the

    Definition group DerivationMethods

        These are the available values for the derivationMethod parameter used
        by the method TypeInfo.isDerivedFrom(). It is a set of possible types
        of derivation, and the values represent bit positions. If a bit in the
        derivationMethod parameter is set to 1, the corresponding type of
        derivation will be taken into account when evaluating the derivation
        between the reference type definition and the other type definition.
        When using the isDerivedFrom method, combining all of them in the
        derivationMethod parameter is equivalent to invoking the method for
        each of them separately and combining the results with the OR boolean
        function. This specification only defines the type of derivation for
        XML Schema.
        
         In addition to the types of derivation listed below, please note
        that:

            * any type derives from xsd:anyType.
            * any simple type derives from xsd:anySimpleType by restriction.
            * any complex type does not derive from xsd:anySimpleType by
              restriction.

                If the document's schema is an XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1],

                If the document's schema is an XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1],
                this constant represents the derivation by restriction if
                complex types are involved, or a restriction if simple types
                are involved.
                
                 The reference type definition is derived by restriction from
                the other type definition if the other type definition is the

Interface DOMConfiguration (introduced in DOM Level 3)

    The DOMConfiguration interface represents the configuration of a document
    and maintains a table of recognized parameters. Using the configuration,
    it is possible to change Document.normalizeDocument() behavior, such as
    replacing the CDATASection nodes with Text nodes or specifying the type of
    the schema that must be used when the validation of the Document is
    requested. DOMConfiguration objects are also used in [DOM Level 3 Load and
    Save] in the DOMParser and DOMSerializer interfaces.
    
     The parameter names used by the DOMConfiguration object are defined
    throughout the DOM Level 3 specifications. Names are case-insensitive. To
    avoid possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring to parameters
    defined outside the DOM specification should be made unique. Because
    parameters are exposed as properties in the ECMAScript Language Binding,
    names are recommended to follow the section "5.16 Identifiers" of
    [Unicode] with the addition of the character '-' (HYPHEN-MINUS) but it is
    not enforced by the DOM implementation. DOM Level 3 Core Implementations
    are required to recognize all parameters defined in this specification.
    Some parameter values may also be required to be supported by the
    implementation. Refer to the definition of the parameter to know if a
    value must be supported or not.
    
     Note: Parameters are similar to features and properties used in SAX2
    [SAX].
    
     The following list of parameters defined in the DOM:

    "canonical-form"

        true
            [optional]
            Canonicalize the document according to the rules specified in
            [Canonical XML], such as removing the DocumentType node (if any)
            from the tree, or removing superfluous namespace declarations from
            each element. Note that this is limited to what can be represented
            in the DOM; in particular, there is no way to specify the order of
            the attributes in the DOM. In addition,
            
             Setting this parameter to true will also set the state of the
            parameters listed below. Later changes to the state of one of
            those parameters will revert "canonical-form" back to false.
            
             Parameters set to false: "entities", "normalize-characters",
            "cdata-sections".
            
             Parameters set to true: "namespaces", "namespace-declarations",
            "well-formed", "element-content-whitespace".
            
             Other parameters are not changed unless explicitly specified in
            the description of the parameters.       
        false

1.5 Extended Interfaces: XML Module

The interfaces defined here form part of the DOM Core specification, but
objects that expose these interfaces will never be encountered in a DOM
implementation that deals only with HTML.

The interfaces found within this section are not mandatory. A DOM application
may use the DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version) method with
parameter values "XML" and "3.0" (respectively) to determine whether or not
this module is supported by the implementation. In order to fully support this
module, an implementation must also support the "Core" feature defined in
Fundamental Interfaces: Core Module and the feature "XMLVersion" with version
"1.0" defined in Document.xmlVersion. Please refer to additional information
about Conformance in this specification. The DOM Level 3 XML module is
backward compatible with the DOM Level 2 XML [DOM Level 2 Core] and DOM Level
1 XML [DOM Level 1] modules, i.e. a DOM Level 3 XML implementation who returns
true for "XML" with the version number "3.0" must also return true for this
feature when the version number is "2.0", "1.0", "" or, null.

Interface CDATASection

    CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters
    that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is
    recognized in a CDATA section is the "]]>" string that ends the CDATA
    section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for
    including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all
    the delimiters.
    
     The CharacterData.data attribute holds the text that is contained by the
    CDATA section. Note that this may contain characters that need to be
    escaped outside of CDATA sections and that, depending on the character
    encoding ("charset") chosen for serialization, it may be impossible to
    write out some characters as part of a CDATA section.
    
     The CDATASection interface inherits from the CharacterData interface
    through the Text interface. Adjacent CDATASection nodes are not merged by
    use of the normalize method of the Node interface.
    
     No lexical check is done on the content of a CDATA section and it is
    therefore possible to have the character sequence "]]>" in the content,
    which is illegal in a CDATA section per section 2.7 of [XML 1.0]. The
    presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during
    serialization or the cdata section must be splitted before the
    serialization (see also the parameter "split-cdata-sections" in the
    DOMConfiguration interface).
    
     Note: Because no markup is recognized within a CDATASection, character
    numeric references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when serializing.
    Therefore, action needs to be taken when serializing a CDATASection with a
    character encoding where some of the contained characters cannot be
    represented. Failure to do so would not produce well-formed XML.

    One potential solution in the serialization process is to end the CDATA
    section before the character, output the character using a character
    reference or entity reference, and open a new CDATA section for any
    further characters in the text node. Note, however, that some code
    conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return an error or
    exception when a character is missing from the encoding, making the task
    of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization more difficult.

Interface DocumentType

    Each Document has a doctype attribute whose value is either null or a
    DocumentType object. The DocumentType interface in the DOM Core provides
    an interface to the list of entities that are defined for the document,
    and little else because the effect of namespaces and the various XML
    schema efforts on DTD representation are not clearly understood as of this
    writing.
    
     DOM Level 3 doesn't support editing DocumentType nodes. DocumentType
    nodes are read-only.


    IDL Definition

        interface DocumentType : Node {
          readonly attribute DOMString       name;
          readonly attribute NamedNodeMap    entities;
          readonly attribute NamedNodeMap    notations;
          // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
          readonly attribute DOMString       publicId;
          // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
          readonly attribute DOMString       systemId;
          // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
          readonly attribute DOMString       internalSubset;
        };


    Attributes

        entities of type NamedNodeMap, readonly
            A NamedNodeMap containing the general entities, both external and
            internal, declared in the DTD. Parameter entities are not
            contained. Duplicates are discarded. For example in:

            <!DOCTYPE ex SYSTEM "ex.dtd" [
              <!ENTITY foo "foo">
              <!ENTITY bar "bar">
              <!ENTITY bar "bar2">
              <!ENTITY % baz "baz">
            ]>
            <ex/>

            the interface provides access to foo and the first declaration of
            bar but not the second declaration of bar or baz. Every node in
            this map also implements the Entity interface.

            The DOM Level 2 does not support editing entities, therefore
            entities cannot be altered in any way.
        internalSubset of type DOMString, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 2
            The internal subset as a string, or null if there is none. This is
            does not contain the delimiting square brackets.

            Note: The actual content returned depends on how much information
            is available to the implementation. This may vary depending on
            various parameters, including the XML processor used to build the
            document.
        name of type DOMString, readonly
            The name of DTD; i.e., the name immediately following the DOCTYPE
            keyword.
        notations of type NamedNodeMap, readonly
            A NamedNodeMap containing the notations declared in the DTD.
            Duplicates are discarded. Every node in this map also implements
            the Notation interface.

            The DOM Level 2 does not support editing notations, therefore
            notations cannot be altered in any way.
        publicId of type DOMString, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 2
            The public identifier of the external subset.
        systemId of type DOMString, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 2

Interface Entity

    This interface represents a known entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an
    XML document. Note that this models the entity itself not the entity
    declaration.
    
     The nodeName attribute that is inherited from Node contains the name of
    the entity.
    
     An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before the
    structure model is passed to the DOM; in this case there will be no
    EntityReference nodes in the document tree.
    
     XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and process
    entity declarations made in the external subset or declared in parameter
    entities. This means that parsed entities declared in the external subset
    need not be expanded by some classes of applications, and that the
    replacement text of the entity may not be available. When the replacement
    text is available, the corresponding Entity node's child list represents
    the structure of that replacement value. Otherwise, the child list is
    empty.
    
     DOM Level 3 does not support editing Entity nodes; if a user wants to
    make changes to the contents of an Entity, every related EntityReference
    node has to be replaced in the structure model by a clone of the Entity's
    contents, and then the desired changes must be made to each of those
    clones instead. Entity nodes and all their descendants are readonly.
    
     An Entity node does not have any parent.
    
     Note: If the entity contains an unbound namespace prefix, the
    namespaceURI of the corresponding node in the Entity node subtree is null.
    The same is true for EntityReference nodes that refer to this entity, when
    they are created using the createEntityReference method of the Document
    interface.

Interface EntityReference

    EntityReference nodes may be used to represent an entity reference in the
    tree. Note that character references and references to predefined entities
    are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that
    characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent rather than by an
    entity reference. Moreover, the XML processor may completely expand
    references to entities while building the Document, instead of providing
    EntityReference nodes. If it does provide such nodes, then for an
    EntityReference node that represents a reference to a known entity an
    Entity exists, and the subtree of the EntityReference node is a copy of
    the Entity node subtree. However, the latter may not be true when an
    entity contains an unbound namespace prefix. In such a case, because the
    namespace prefix resolution depends on where the entity reference is, the
    descendants of the EntityReference node may be bound to different
    namespace URIs. When an EntityReference node represents a reference to an
    unknown entity, the node has no children and its replacement value, when
    used by Attr.value for example, is empty.
    
     As for Entity nodes, EntityReference nodes and all their descendants are
    readonly.
    
     Note: EntityReference nodes may cause element content and attribute value
    normalization problems when, such as in XML 1.0 and XML Schema, the
