2.1. Overview of the DOM Level 2 CSS Interfaces

The DOM Level 2 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) interfaces are designed with the goal of exposing CSS constructs to object model consumers. Cascading Style Sheets is a declarative syntax for defining presentation rules, properties and ancillary constructs used to format and render Web documents. This document specifies a mechanism to programmatically access and modify the rich style and presentation control provided by CSS (specifically CSS level 2 [CSS2]). This augments CSS by providing a mechanism to dynamically control the inclusion and exclusion of individual style sheets, as well as manipulate CSS rules and properties.

The CSS interfaces are organized in a logical, rather than physical structure. A collection of all style sheets referenced by or embedded in the document is accessible on the document interface. Each item in this collection exposes the properties common to all style sheets referenced or embedded in HTML and XML documents; this interface is described in the Document Object Model Style Sheets. User style sheets are not accessible through this collection, in part due to potential privacy concerns (and certainly read-write issues).

For each CSS style sheet, an additional interface is exposed - the CSSStyleSheet interface. This interface allows access to the collection of rules within a CSS style sheet and methods to modify that collection. Interfaces are provided for each specific type of rule in CSS2 (e.g. style declarations, @import rules, or @font-face rules), as well as a shared generic CSSRule interface.

The most common type of rule is a style declaration. The CSSStyleRule interface that represents this type of rule provides string access to the CSS selector of the rule, and access to the property declarations through the CSSStyleDeclaration interface.

Finally, an optional CSS2Properties interface is described; this interface (if implemented) provides shortcuts to the string values of all the properties in CSS level 2.

All CSS objects in the DOM are "live", that is, a change in the style sheet is reflected in the computed and actual style.
2.2. CSS Fundamental Interfaces

The interfaces within this section are considered fundamental CSS interfaces, and must be supported by all conforming implementations of the CSS module. These interfaces represent CSS style sheets specifically.

A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "CSS" and "2.0" (respectively) to determine whether or not this module is supported by the implementation. In order to fully support this module, an implementation must also support the "Core" feature defined defined in the DOM Level 2 Core specification [DOM Level 2 Core] and the "Views" feature defined in the DOM Level 2 Views specification [DOM Level 2 Views]. Please refer to additional information about conformance in the DOM Level 2 Core specification [DOM Level 2 Core].

Interface CSSStyleSheet (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSStyleSheet interface is a concrete interface used to represent a CSS style sheet i.e., a style sheet whose content type is "text/css".


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSStyleSheet : stylesheets::StyleSheet {
          readonly attribute CSSRule          ownerRule;
          readonly attribute CSSRuleList      cssRules;
          unsigned long      insertRule(in DOMString rule, 
                                        in unsigned long index)
                                                raises(DOMException);
          void               deleteRule(in unsigned long index)
                                                raises(DOMException);
        };


    Attributes

        cssRules of type CSSRuleList, readonly
            The list of all CSS rules contained within the style sheet. This includes both rule sets and at-rules.
        ownerRule of type CSSRule, readonly
            If this style sheet comes from an @import rule, the ownerRule attribute will contain the CSSImportRule. In that case, the ownerNode attribute in the StyleSheet interface will be null. If the style sheet comes from an element or a processing instruction, the ownerRule attribute will be null and the ownerNode attribute will contain the Node.

    Methods

        deleteRule
            Used to delete a rule from the style sheet.
            Parameters

            index of type unsigned long
                The index within the style sheet's rule list of the rule to remove.

            Exceptions

            DOMException
            	

            INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified index does not correspond to a rule in the style sheet's rule list.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this style sheet is readonly.
            No Return Value
        insertRule
            Used to insert a new rule into the style sheet. The new rule now becomes part of the cascade.
            Parameters

            rule of type DOMString
                The parsable text representing the rule. For rule sets this contains both the selector and the style declaration. For at-rules, this specifies both the at-identifier and the rule content.
            index of type unsigned long
                The index within the style sheet's rule list of the rule before which to insert the specified rule. If the specified index is equal to the length of the style sheet's rule collection, the rule will be added to the end of the style sheet.

            Return Value

            unsigned long
            	

            The index within the style sheet's rule collection of the newly inserted rule.
            Exceptions

            DOMException
            	

            HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the rule cannot be inserted at the specified index e.g. if an @import rule is inserted after a standard rule set or other at-rule.

            INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified index is not a valid insertion point.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this style sheet is readonly.

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified rule has a syntax error and is unparsable.

Interface CSSRuleList (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSRuleList interface provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of CSS rules.

    The items in the CSSRuleList are accessible via an integral index, starting from 0.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSRuleList {
          readonly attribute unsigned long    length;
          CSSRule            item(in unsigned long index);
        };


    Attributes

        length of type unsigned long, readonly
            The number of CSSRules in the list. The range of valid child rule indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive.

    Methods

        item
            Used to retrieve a CSS rule by ordinal index. The order in this collection represents the order of the rules in the CSS style sheet. If index is greater than or equal to the number of rules in the list, this returns null.
            Parameters

            index of type unsigned long
                Index into the collection

            Return Value

            CSSRule
            	

            The style rule at the index position in the CSSRuleList, or null if that is not a valid index.
            No Exceptions

Interface CSSRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSRule interface is the abstract base interface for any type of CSS statement. This includes both rule sets and at-rules. An implementation is expected to preserve all rules specified in a CSS style sheet, even if the rule is not recognized by the parser. Unrecognized rules are represented using the CSSUnknownRule interface.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSRule {

          // RuleType
          const unsigned short      UNKNOWN_RULE                   = 0;
          const unsigned short      STYLE_RULE                     = 1;
          const unsigned short      CHARSET_RULE                   = 2;
          const unsigned short      IMPORT_RULE                    = 3;
          const unsigned short      MEDIA_RULE                     = 4;
          const unsigned short      FONT_FACE_RULE                 = 5;
          const unsigned short      PAGE_RULE                      = 6;

          readonly attribute unsigned short   type;
                   attribute DOMString        cssText;
                                                // raises(DOMException) on setting

          readonly attribute CSSStyleSheet    parentStyleSheet;
          readonly attribute CSSRule          parentRule;
        };

    Attributes

        cssText of type DOMString
            The parsable textual representation of the rule. This reflects the current state of the rule and not its initial value.
            Exceptions on setting

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value has a syntax error and is unparsable.

            INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value represents a different type of rule than the current one.

            HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the rule cannot be inserted at this point in the style sheet.

            The style sheet that contains this rule.
        type of type unsigned short, readonly
            The type of the rule, as defined above. The expectation is that binding-specific casting methods can be used to cast down from an instance of the CSSRule interface to the specific derived interface implied by the type.

Interface CSSStyleRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSStyleRule interface represents a single rule set in a CSS style sheet.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSStyleRule : CSSRule {
                   attribute DOMString        selectorText;
                                                // raises(DOMException) on setting

        };


    Attributes

        selectorText of type DOMString
            The textual representation of the selector for the rule set. The implementation may have stripped out insignificant whitespace while parsing the selector.

        style of type CSSStyleDeclaration, readonly
            The declaration-block of this rule set.

Interface CSSMediaRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSMediaRule interface represents a @media rule in a CSS style sheet. A @media rule can be used to delimit style rules for specific media types.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSMediaRule : CSSRule {
          readonly attribute stylesheets::MediaList  media;
          readonly attribute CSSRuleList      cssRules;
          unsigned long      insertRule(in DOMString rule, 
                                        in unsigned long index)
                                                raises(DOMException);
          void               deleteRule(in unsigned long index)
                                                raises(DOMException);

            Parameters

            index of type unsigned long
                The index within the media block's rule collection of the rule to remove.

            Exceptions

            DOMException
            	

            INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified index does not correspond to a rule in the media rule list.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this media rule is readonly.
            No Return Value
        insertRule
            Used to insert a new rule into the media block.
            Parameters

            rule of type DOMString
                The parsable text representing the rule. For rule sets this contains both the selector and the style declaration. For at-rules, this specifies both the at-identifier and the rule content.
            index of type unsigned long
                The index within the media block's rule collection of the rule before which to insert the specified rule. If the specified index is equal to the length of the media blocks's rule collection, the rule will be added to the end of the media block.

            Return Value

            unsigned long
            	

            The index within the media block's rule collection of the newly inserted rule.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this media rule is readonly.

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified rule has a syntax error and is unparsable.

Interface CSSFontFaceRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSFontFaceRule interface represents a @font-face rule in a CSS style sheet. The @font-face rule is used to hold a set of font descriptions.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSFontFaceRule : CSSRule {
          readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration  style;
        };


    Attributes

        style of type CSSStyleDeclaration, readonly
            The declaration-block of this rule.

Interface CSSPageRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSPageRule interface represents a @page rule within a CSS style sheet. The @page rule is used to specify the dimensions, orientation, margins, etc. of a page box for paged media.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSPageRule : CSSRule {
                   attribute DOMString        selectorText;
                                                // raises(DOMException) on setting

          readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration  style;
        };


    Attributes

        selectorText of type DOMString
            The parsable textual representation of the page selector for the rule.
            Exceptions on setting

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value has a syntax error and is unparsable.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this rule is readonly.
        style of type CSSStyleDeclaration, readonly
            The declaration-block of this rule.

Interface CSSImportRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSImportRule interface represents a @import rule within a CSS style sheet. The @import rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSImportRule : CSSRule {
          readonly attribute DOMString        href;
          readonly attribute stylesheets::MediaList  media;
          readonly attribute CSSStyleSheet    styleSheet;
        };


    Attributes

        href of type DOMString, readonly
            The location of the style sheet to be imported. The attribute will not contain the "url(...)" specifier around the URI.
        media of type stylesheets::MediaList, readonly
            A list of media types for which this style sheet may be used.
        styleSheet of type CSSStyleSheet, readonly
            The style sheet referred to by this rule, if it has been loaded. The value of this attribute is null if the style sheet has not yet been loaded or if it will not be loaded (e.g. if the style sheet is for a media type not supported by the user agent).

Interface CSSCharsetRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSCharsetRule interface represents a @charset rule in a CSS style sheet. The value of the encoding attribute does not affect the encoding of text data in the DOM objects; this encoding is always UTF-16. After a stylesheet is loaded, the value of the encoding attribute is the value found in the @charset rule. If there was no @charset in the original document, then no CSSCharsetRule is created. The value of the encoding attribute may also be used as a hint for the encoding used on serialization of the style sheet.

    The value of the @charset rule (and therefore of the CSSCharsetRule) may not correspond to the encoding the document actually came in; character encoding information e.g. in an HTTP header, has priority (see CSS document representation) but this is not reflected in the CSSCharsetRule.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSCharsetRule : CSSRule {
                   attribute DOMString        encoding;
                                                // raises(DOMException) on setting

        };


    Attributes

        encoding of type DOMString
            The encoding information used in this @charset rule.
            Exceptions on setting

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified encoding value has a syntax error and is unparsable.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this encoding rule is readonly.

Interface CSSUnknownRule (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSUnknownRule interface represents an at-rule not supported by this user agent.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSUnknownRule : CSSRule {
        };


Interface CSSStyleDeclaration (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSStyleDeclaration interface represents a single CSS declaration block. This interface may be used to determine the style properties currently set in a block or to set style properties explicitly within the block.

    While an implementation may not recognize all CSS properties within a CSS declaration block, it is expected to provide access to all specified properties in the style sheet through the CSSStyleDeclaration interface. Furthermore, implementations that support a specific level of CSS should correctly handle CSS shorthand properties for that level. For a further discussion of shorthand properties, see the CSS2Properties interface.

    This interface is also used to provide a read-only access to the computed values of an element. See also the ViewCSS interface.

    Note: The CSS Object Model doesn't provide an access to the specified or actual values of the CSS cascade.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSStyleDeclaration {
                   attribute DOMString        cssText;
                                                // raises(DOMException) on setting

          DOMString          getPropertyValue(in DOMString propertyName);
          CSSValue           getPropertyCSSValue(in DOMString propertyName);
          DOMString          removeProperty(in DOMString propertyName)
                                                raises(DOMException);
          DOMString          getPropertyPriority(in DOMString propertyName);

                                         in DOMString priority)
                                                raises(DOMException);
          readonly attribute unsigned long    length;
          DOMString          item(in unsigned long index);
          readonly attribute CSSRule          parentRule;
        };


    Attributes

        cssText of type DOMString
            The parsable textual representation of the declaration block (excluding the surrounding curly braces). Setting this attribute will result in the parsing of the new value and resetting of all the properties in the declaration block including the removal or addition of properties.
            Exceptions on setting

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value has a syntax error and is unparsable.

        };


    Definition group UnitTypes

        An integer indicating which type of unit applies to the value.

        Defined Constants

            CSS_CUSTOM
                The value is a custom value.
            CSS_INHERIT
                The value is inherited and the cssText contains "inherit".
            CSS_PRIMITIVE_VALUE
                The value is a primitive value and an instance of the CSSPrimitiveValue interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on this instance of the CSSValue interface.
            CSS_VALUE_LIST
                The value is a CSSValue list and an instance of the CSSValueList interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on this instance of the CSSValue interface.

    Attributes

        cssText of type DOMString
            A string representation of the current value.
            Exceptions on setting

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value has a syntax error (according to the attached property) or is unparsable.

            INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value represents a different type of values than the values allowed by the CSS property.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this value is readonly.
        cssValueType of type unsigned short, readonly
            A code defining the type of the value as defined above.

Interface CSSPrimitiveValue (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSPrimitiveValue interface represents a single CSS value. This interface may be used to determine the value of a specific style property currently set in a block or to set a specific style property explicitly within the block. An instance of this interface might be obtained from the getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface. A CSSPrimitiveValue object only occurs in a context of a CSS property.

    Conversions are allowed between absolute values (from millimeters to centimeters, from degrees to radians, and so on) but not between relative values. (For example, a pixel value cannot be converted to a centimeter value.) Percentage values can't be converted since they are relative to the parent value (or another property value). There is one exception for color percentage values: since a color percentage value is relative to the range 0-255, a color percentage value can be converted to a number; (see also the RGBColor interface).

                A string code as defined above. The string code can only be a string unit type (i.e. CSS_STRING, CSS_URI, CSS_IDENT, and CSS_ATTR).
            stringValue of type DOMString
                The new string value.

            Exceptions

            DOMException
            	

            INVALID_ACCESS_ERR: Raised if the CSS value doesn't contain a string value or if the string value can't be converted into the specified unit.

            NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this property is readonly.
            No Return Value

Interface CSSValueList (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSSValueList interface provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of CSS values.

    Some properties allow an empty list into their syntax. In that case, these properties take the none identifier. So, an empty list means that the property has the value none.

    The items in the CSSValueList are accessible via an integral index, starting from 0.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface CSSValueList : CSSValue {
          readonly attribute unsigned long    length;
          CSSValue           item(in unsigned long index);
        };


    Attributes

        length of type unsigned long, readonly
            The number of CSSValues in the list. The range of valid values of the indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive.

    Methods

        item
            Used to retrieve a CSSValue by ordinal index. The order in this collection represents the order of the values in the CSS style property. If index is greater than or equal to the number of values in the list, this returns null.
            Parameters

            index of type unsigned long
                Index into the collection.

            Return Value

            CSSValue
            	

            The CSSValue at the index position in the CSSValueList, or null if that is not a valid index.
            No Exceptions

Interface RGBColor (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The RGBColor interface is used to represent any RGB color value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style property. Hence, modifications made to the CSSPrimitiveValue objects modify the style property.

    A specified RGB color is not clipped (even if the number is outside the range 0-255 or 0%-100%). A computed RGB color is clipped depending on the device.

    Even if a style sheet can only contain an integer for a color value, the internal storage of this integer is a float, and this can be used as a float in the specified or the computed style.

    A color percentage value can always be converted to a number and vice versa.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface RGBColor {
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  red;
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  green;
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  blue;
        };


    Attributes

        blue of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the blue value of the RGB color.
        green of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the green value of the RGB color.
        red of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the red value of the RGB color.

Interface Rect (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The Rect interface is used to represent any rect value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style property. Hence, modifications made to the CSSPrimitiveValue objects modify the style property.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface Rect {
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  top;
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  right;
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  bottom;
          readonly attribute CSSPrimitiveValue  left;
        };


    Attributes

        bottom of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the bottom of the rect.
        left of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the left of the rect.
        right of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the right of the rect.
        top of type CSSPrimitiveValue, readonly
            This attribute is used for the top of the rect.

Interface Counter (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The Counter interface is used to represent any counter or counters function value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style property.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface Counter {
          readonly attribute DOMString        identifier;
          readonly attribute DOMString        listStyle;
          readonly attribute DOMString        separator;
        };


    Attributes

        identifier of type DOMString, readonly
            This attribute is used for the identifier of the counter.
        listStyle of type DOMString, readonly
            This attribute is used for the style of the list.
        separator of type DOMString, readonly
            This attribute is used for the separator of the nested counters.

2.2.1. Override and computed style sheet

Interface ViewCSS (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    This interface represents a CSS view. The getComputedStyle method provides a read only access to the computed values of an element.

    The expectation is that an instance of the ViewCSS interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the AbstractView interface.

    Since a computed style is related to an Element node, if this element is removed from the document, the associated CSSStyleDeclaration and CSSValue related to this declaration are no longer valid.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface ViewCSS : views::AbstractView {
          CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedStyle(in Element elt, 
                                               in DOMString pseudoElt);
        };


    Methods

        getComputedStyle
            This method is used to get the computed style as it is defined in [CSS2].
            Parameters

            elt of type Element
                The element whose style is to be computed. This parameter cannot be null.
            pseudoElt of type DOMString
                The pseudo-element or null if none.

            Return Value

            CSSStyleDeclaration
            	

            The computed style. The CSSStyleDeclaration is read-only and contains only absolute values.
            No Exceptions

Interface DocumentCSS (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    This interface represents a document with a CSS view.

    The getOverrideStyle method provides a mechanism through which a DOM author could effect immediate change to the style of an element without modifying the explicitly linked style sheets of a document or the inline style of elements in the style sheets. This style sheet comes after the author style sheet in the cascade algorithm and is called override style sheet. The override style sheet takes precedence over author style sheets. An "!important" declaration still takes precedence over a normal declaration. Override, author, and user style sheets all may contain "!important" declarations. User "!important" rules take precedence over both override and author "!important" rules, and override "!important" rules take precedence over author "!important" rules.

    The expectation is that an instance of the DocumentCSS interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Document interface.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface DocumentCSS : stylesheets::DocumentStyle {
          CSSStyleDeclaration getOverrideStyle(in Element elt, 
                                               in DOMString pseudoElt);
        };


    Methods

        getOverrideStyle
            This method is used to retrieve the override style declaration for a specified element and a specified pseudo-element.
            Parameters

            elt of type Element
                The element whose style is to be modified. This parameter cannot be null.
            pseudoElt of type DOMString
                The pseudo-element or null if none.

            Return Value

            CSSStyleDeclaration
            	

            The override style declaration.
            No Exceptions

2.2.2. Style sheet creation

Interface DOMImplementationCSS (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    This interface allows the DOM user to create a CSSStyleSheet outside the context of a document. There is no way to associate the new CSSStyleSheet with a document in DOM Level 2.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM   Level 2:
        interface DOMImplementationCSS : DOMImplementation {
          CSSStyleSheet      createCSSStyleSheet(in DOMString title, 
                                                 in DOMString media)
                                                raises(DOMException);
        };


    Methods

        createCSSStyleSheet
            Creates a new CSSStyleSheet.
            Parameters

            title of type DOMString
                The advisory title. See also the Style Sheet Interfaces section.
            media of type DOMString
                The comma-separated list of media associated with the new style sheet. See also the Style Sheet Interfaces section.

            Return Value

            CSSStyleSheet
            	

            A new CSS style sheet.
            Exceptions

            DOMException
            	

            SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified media string value has a syntax error and is unparsable.

2.2.3. Element with CSS inline style

Interface ElementCSSInlineStyle (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    Inline style information attached to elements is exposed through the style attribute. This represents the contents of the STYLE attribute for HTML elements (or elements in other schemas or DTDs which use the STYLE attribute in the same way). The expectation is that an instance of the ElementCSSInlineStyle interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Element interface when the element supports inline CSS style informations.


    IDL Definition

        // Introduced in DOM Level 2:
        interface ElementCSSInlineStyle {
          readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration  style;
        };


    Attributes

        style of type CSSStyleDeclaration, readonly
            The style attribute.

2.3. CSS2 Extended Interface

The interface found within this section are not mandatory. A DOM application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "CSS2" and "2.0" (respectively) to determine whether or not this module is supported by the implementation. In order to fully support this module, an implementation must also support the "CSS" feature defined defined in CSS Fundamental Interfaces. Please refer to additional information about conformance in the DOM Level 2 Core specification [DOM Level 2 Core].

Interface CSS2Properties (introduced in DOM Level 2)

    The CSS2Properties interface represents a convenience mechanism for retrieving and setting properties within a CSSStyleDeclaration. The attributes of this interface correspond to all the properties specified in CSS2. Getting an attribute of this interface is equivalent to calling the getPropertyValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface. Setting an attribute of this interface is equivalent to calling the setProperty method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface.

    A conformant implementation of the CSS module is not required to implement the CSS2Properties interface. If an implementation does implement this interface, the expectation is that language-specific methods can be used to cast from an instance of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface to the CSS2Properties interface.

    If an implementation does implement this interface, it is expected to understand the specific syntax of the shorthand properties, and apply their semantics; when the margin property is set, for example, the marginTop, marginRight, marginBottom and marginLeft properties are actually being set by the underlying implementation.

    When dealing with CSS "shorthand" properties, the shorthand properties should be decomposed into their component longhand properties as appropriate, and when querying for their value, the form returned should be the shortest form exactly equivalent to the declarations made in the ruleset. However, if there is no shorthand declaration that could be added to the ruleset without changing in any way the rules already declared in the ruleset (i.e., by adding longhand rules that were previously not declared in the ruleset), then the empty string should be returned for the shorthand property.

    For example, querying for the font property should not return "normal normal normal 14pt/normal Arial, sans-serif", when "14pt Arial, sans-serif" suffices. (The normals are initial values, and are implied by use of the longhand property.)

    If the values for all the longhand properties that compose a particular string are the initial values, then a string consisting of all the initial values should be returned (e.g. a border-width value of "medium" should be returned as such, not as "").

    For some shorthand properties that take missing values from other sides, such as the margin, padding, and border-[width|style|color] properties, the minimum number of sides possible should be used; i.e., "0px 10px" will be returned instead of "0px 10px 0px 10px".

    If the value of a shorthand property can not be decomposed into its component longhand properties, as is the case for the font property with a value of "menu", querying for the values of the component longhand properties should return the empty string.
